The evolving kingdoms plan
--------------------------

There would be a number of GM-designed game kingdoms.

Characters could join one kingdom, subject to the approval of the
kingdom's leader.

Some kingdoms (not all) grant the right to own land.  Members of these
kingdoms may claim ownership of a province by attacking any existing
garrison and installing their own.  The character who actually installs
the garrison becomes the direct owner.

	Drassa [cy76], province
	-----------------------

	Routes leaving Drassa:
	   ...

	Ruled by Osswid [5501], of the Imperial Kingdom
	Garrison [3653]: ten pikemen, three knights

  o The owner may add or remove soldiers from the garrison.

  o The owner is entitled to the tax generated by the garrison. [1]

  o The owner receives a location report for the garrisoned province.

  o The kingdom leader receives a short summary of the provinces claimed
    by the kingdom, and their direct owner.  He does not receive a location
    report for each province.

  o The direct owner may give ownership of a province to another member of
    the kingdom.

The leader of the kingdom may reassign ownership of a province from
one character to another, at will.

  o A leader would likely do this when the direct owner of a province died. 
    Although the province would remain part of the kingdom, no character
    would exist to claim the taxes or to have access to the soldiers.

Garrison units guard against pillaging.

  o The direct owner may pillage in his own provinces.

  o Some kingdoms are configured such that garrison units implicitly DEFEND
    members of the kingdom.  Other are not.

  o Some kingdoms allow the leader to designated units which may freely
    attack within the kingdom, without interference from the garrisons.
    This includes pillaging.


Example:  The Imperial Realm

	Leader:  Emperor

	Members may claim lands in the name of the Imperial Realm
	Each garrison collects 30 gold/month, and sustains any number
	of soldiers without maintenance.

	Garrison units DEFEND members of the realm.

	The Emperor may designate Marshalls, with right of free attack
	and pillage.

Benefits of membership depends on which kingdom you join:

  o Imperial Citizens may own land and collect taxes from them.

  o The Barbarian Horde gets stronger with each victory in battle.

  o Members of the Orc/Savage/Skeleton kingdoms may raise an NPC unit
    from each owned province.

Perhaps groups with no interest in land ownership, such as guilds or
other secret societies, could later be worked into this system.  Initially,
however, the design is meant to pit various groups against one another in
the arena of land control through military might.

  o The Imperial Realm provides defense to its members, and tax revenue
    to those who expand it.

  o The goal of the Barbarian Horde is to find garrisons and destroy them.

  o The orcs/savages/skeletons gain strength through expanded territory,
    by being able to increase their numbers. [2]

How does one become leader of a kingdom?  I don't know.  It would likely
vary from kingdom to kingdom.

  o Could rest on possession of an artifact.

  o Perhaps Imperial landowners vote in their emperor.

  o Maybe you have to kill the old Barbarian King to take his place.

  o Perhaps the Dark Overlord has the power to appoint the leaders of some
    kingdoms.  Say, DO could appoint the Orc King and the Savage King.
    DO may kill them at will.  I have no idea how you become Dark Overlord.

I have some other ideas for kingdoms, less well developed.  Complete kingdom
designs are welcome.  I see no problem with having lots and lots of possible
kingdoms to join.  Another benefit available from membership could be the use
of an otherwise unobtainable skill.  For instance, perhaps the Sea kings know
how to make a special kind of boat that no one else can build.

Notes:

[1]
	Olympian physics suggests that the direct owner would have to
	visit the garrison and TAKE any gold collected in taxes from them.
	I don't like the idea of automatically teleporting tax revenue to
 	a castle or the owner.  This naturally limits the number of
	provinces a single noble could directly own, and force a visit by
	him at least every so often, lest his garrisons become targets ripe
	for attack.

[2]
	The orcs/savages/skeletons would grow in strength too quickly.
	Perhaps, if their leaders are appointed by the Dark Overlord,
	they may raise units from DO owned provinces, and claim land
	in his name.  Whatever...

Comments on the plan:

Pro:

Several months ago I raised the possibility that players could control
NPC factions in the first alpha _Times_.  I was surprised by the large
response.  "I don't really have time to play Olympia, but if you let me
be the Demon Horde I will make time.  Pretty please..."

Everyone, it seems, wants to have a special role in the game, and lots
of players are starving for defined goals (in some cases, the bloodier the
better).

This kingdoms plan has much in common with NPC factions, except instead
of having a GM-level role, the player controlled groups must fight it out
themselves.  Hopefully this will give everyone yearning to play an NPC
faction what they want.

Con:

The plan is slightly complex and unwieldy.  I expect this to work itself
out as the list of kingdoms, their benefits, goals, and routes to attaining
the leader role develops.

I'm starting to agree that a form of land ownership independent of
nobles is necessary.  Some sort of mechanism where a garrison of
men would be left in a province, providing the owner with a location
report.  Ownership of a province would be obtained by attacking the
existing garrison.

The garrison would be capable of only limited commands.

I'm not sure exactly what mechanism to use to represent the garrison.
Possibilities are a unit (such as the peasant mobs), a structure such
as a fort, or the location entity itself.

	Drassa [cy76], province
	-----------------------

	Routes leaving Drassa:
	   ...

	Ruled by Osswid [5501]
	Garrison: ten pikemen, three knights



	Drassa [cy76], province
	-----------------------

	Routes leaving Drassa:
	   ...

	Ruled by Osswid [5501], of the Imperial Kingdom

I don't think it will be necessary to put lots of teeth into land
ownership.  Simply having an official way to claim a province, and
a permanent watch over it, should be enough to enforce control.

As for organizations:  they are groups of characters, with one noble
designated as the leader.  Land may be owned by an organanization,
although land control is not necessarily a goal of every group.
Certainly the Imperial Realm wants to control as many provinces as
possible, but the Brotherhood of Thieves has a different agenda.

This doesn't quite fit together...yet.  I have a couple of vague problems:

	1.  What inducement is there for a character to give land
	    to a group?  Why would Osswid donate his 10 provinces to
	    the Imperial Realm?  What benefit would he gain?

	2.  Could there be some way to hierarchically structure ownership?
	    For instance, Osswid would retain direct ownership of his
	    10 provinces, but his commitment to the Imperial Realm would
	    also places these provinces under their control?

	    I don't see how this could work, but maybe someone will have
	    a good idea.

Olympia is suffering from a lack of plot.  The props are all on the stage,
but the actors have no idea what play they're supposed to be in.  There
have been few in-game intruiges, alliances, wars.

There are two major reasons for this:

    Resources are nearly limitless

	The map is huge, allowing players to pick up and move if there
	is any dispute over resources.

	There are no artifacts to fight over or quest for.

	It's not really possible to control land in Olympia.  Castles,
	despite their considerable expense, don't effectively stake a
	claim to any natural resources.  Land control would make
	naturual resources scarcer.

	Acquiring skills is a solitary business.  Other players can
	neither help nor hinder research or study.

    There are no in-game organizations to force conflict

	In the absence of limited resources, game rules can force
	players into conflict.  Legends and Out Time Days have been
	offered as examples of games which do this well.  Players
	may join game alliances which provide goals.


As a practical matter, the map may indeed be too large.  However, I do
not think shrinking it would help much.  It would have to be a lot
smaller to force resource conflict, and many players prefer a large
world to a small one.

The "wilderness" idea is one way to make the world apparently smaller,
by making it dangerous to travel.  Allowing true land control is another
way.  Some players would naturally go about staking claim to chunks of
land.  Other players would have to overcome them, or pay taxes, etc.

Generally artifacts are not potent enough to force players to fight over.
I have some ideas about how artifacts can be worked into a quest system
which might provide some good player interaction, but this doesn't seem
powerful enough to involve all of Olympia.  It could be a nice side show.

Game organizations seem to the best bet for dragging players into
alliances, giving them in-game goals, and forcing them into wars,
alliances, etc. with each other.

The design of an organziation system, however, is far from obvious.
Simply creating groups for characters to join doesn't help.  Olympia I
had those with the guilds, and while players were eager to join despite
a high cost and the lack of any benefits, no conflict was spurred.

The groups must have goals.

There should be an internal ladder or tree of ranks within each
organzation, for characters to climb.

Organizations must be somehow scored or graded, perhaps on honor,
land controlled, or gold in the treasury.


Refutation of objections:

    An objection to game supported groups which I often hear is that the
    players will form their own.  Player-formed groups do not, unfortunately,
    have game sponsored goals.  Also, while one about out of 20 players will
    attempt to create some sort of group, the level of participation in
    these informal groups is quite low.

    An objection to land control is that newbies will have a hard time
    getting ahead in a world of well established players.  In general,
    there is no help for this, which is why players who want to be a
    major force in a game should get in as early as possible.  Players
    who join half-way through a game should realize their disadvantage.
    Still, steps can be taken to offset this problem, such as using CLAIM,
    or starting each player with ownership of some resource laden land.


Preliminary conclusions:


     o	There must be a way to own land, which does not require a noble
	to be present.

	Perhaps nobles can garrison locations with men, and the locations
	would then be able to perform a few limited actions.

     o	There must be GM created game organzations.

		Characters may join them.
		Groups must have goals.
		Group standing must be measured in some way.









Proposal #1
-----------

Most of the map now is governed by anarchy, or informal alliances.

The idea of civilization vs. wilderness already exists to a small degree,
with safe havens where new players start.

Set up an imperial government:

	would rule locations

	ruled locations would, in general, need to be adjacent

	The imperial realm would start at some central "safe haven"
	city and thus expand outward.

	The imperial realm has the goal of expansion.  Occupants of
	terrority would want to resist this.

	Government would have many positions:

		Imperial ruler / Emperor	holder of the xxx
			controls imperial troops
			income comes from castle owners

			may appoint those who can train elite guard (?)

		castle owners			appointed by emperor
			allowed to tax
			automatically provide income to emperor
			may control n provinces?  civilian troops?

			may appoint those who can train knights (?)

		guild hall leaders		elected by populace
			pays a small salary

		keeper of the archives		appointed by guild hall leaders

		Imperial Administrator		appointed by Emperor
						guild hall leaders may veto
			sets taxes (?)



     o	Empire would probably be very small in relation to the size
	of the world

     o	Provides a structured political system for those who want to
	participate.  Others could easily find anarchy in the wilderness
	outside the realm

	The imperial realm would be similiar to safe havens now, except
	there would be incentives for the players to expand it over time.

     o	Create a group of gamers with separate goals.


Civilization/Wilderness

Imperial domain

Limits/abilities

	Ability to train certain kinds of men
	Grant powerful units
	Give info reports

Ways to get into a position:

Positions may confer:

	ability to appoint nobles to other positions
	a monthly amount of money which may be obtained


Teeth:
	reports from subject realms
	stationed civilian guard units to enforce laws
	ability to arrest individuals

Possible laws:

	No killing
	No pillaging
	No force > n may enter


What else do people do in civilization?

	impose port fees
	impose city entrance tax
	impose market use tax
	impose head tax

	search all citizens (for xxx)
	seize/arrest character

	outlaw X


Region capitals

	Ownership gives special title (?)


Must be a way to slave one domain to another,
and a way to create multiple-province domains


Special reports

	Location of ships (?)

Guild titles, too

	Keeper of the Archives
	President of the Gatemaster's Guild
	Secret Society of the Dark Night


Titles would be resources like other items (gate crystals, for instance).

You have obtained:

	Guild title power [xy99]

> name xy99 "Keeper of the Archives"
> appoint xy99 3906 "Director of Lore"
> title xy99 3906 "Director of Lore"
Created title Director of Lore [xx98].
Appointed Osswid [3906] to Director of Lore [xx98].

Titles:

	Keeper of the Archives [xy99]

	who	position
	---	--------
	3906	Director of Lore [xx98]


Each skill school has a guild title.

> support xc99 yy99

> title yy99 endorse xx  ==>  support ff00 ii00
			      (only title owners surveyed)

	Overseer of Guilds

> appoint



After having finally added faction trees to Olympia, my
impression is that they are, in fact, useless.

Safe Havens are an important concept, especially for new players
entering the game.  It seems useful to have some distinction between
wilderness and civilization.


Social positions table/system

	item conferred titles
	powers of positions/titles:
		appoint other positions
		generate money
		special reports

	Emperor of Olympia
		perhaps synthesis of ...
	King
	Imperator

	Finance Minister
	Director of Security
	Director of Shipping
		impose shipping fee
	Deacon of the Archives

	Land Titles
		Title to Reston House
		Title to Farnstone Estate [xx88], located in [xx00], in
			Greater Atnos.

	Captial city on each continent
	CAMPAIGN title
	<speak out against officeholder> [anonymous]
		<discover source of rumors>
	<speak on behalf of officeholder>
	support <noble> <office>

	ARREST <individual>
		civil guard tries to apprehend
		(perhaps civil guard is implicit?)

	instead of safe haven:  under imperial law
		means civil guard is in effect
		local authority with ARREST power
		arrest {execute, loc | individual, expel}

		local ruler can agree to join the imperial nation
		with a command, or seceed.
		but must be adjacent.
		gives up some power to imperial command hierarchy
		gives up some taxes?  imperial tax rate, 0-100%?

		establish civilian guard command
		what about GUARD command?

From skrenta Fri Nov 19 17:48:39 1993
Subject: Politics, game organizations
To: design@rt.com
Date: Fri, 19 Nov 93 17:48:39 EST

Some good ideas have come out of the recent political discussion.
I'm happy with the minor castle site simplification, and the tax tweak.
I like the idea only allowing elite guards and elite archers to be trained
inside of castles.  I like scaling building income to the percentage that
the building is undamaged.

I also have a few ideas for religion, including a "blessed soldier"
that priests can produce inside of temples (from regular soldier; only
difference is a 50% chance that the blessed soldier will survive a hit).

However, I'm growing increasingly wary of loading politics and building
requirements directly onto castles (and other castle-like structures).
I don't want to gunk up what appears to be a clean, simple and working
system.

A player in Olympia I once wrote:

I'd like to explore having some in-game organizations which players
could join.  These might be represent guilds (similar to Oly I's guilds,
except without the fixed towers), teams/factions from games like Legends,
or religions.

    Let's proceed assuming that, at least initially, most game groups will
    be gm-designed.

Some possible game groups:

	Magician's Guild
	Brotherhood of Night		(stealth, thieve's guild)
	Servants of the Bloody Axe	(combat, domination goals)
	Followers of Zintar		(a religion)

I have a vague notion that each group would have several positions
which could be held by nobles.  For example, the Followers of Zintar
might have two positions:

	High Priest
	Bishop of Admissions
	Temple Overseer

Only those who had studied a certain priestly skill school (Religion [xxx])
could join the order.  Additionally, the noble occupying the position of
Bishop of Admissions would have to approve any admission.

The High Priest would by voted into office by member priests who also
owned temples, and would serve until death or retirement.  The High
Priest appoints the Bishop of Admissions and the Temple Overseer
(members who could not be from the same faction)

The High Priest would have some non-trivial power vested by Zintar.

The Temple Overseer would get a location report for every temple owned
by a member.

Goal of order:
  Perhaps Zintar despises the study and practice of Necromancy.
  Zintarites could have no necromancers in their factions, and a priest
  who killed a necromancer would gain honor (or maybe NP's) for both
  himself as well as the order.

 *  *  *

Well, that example is a crude first stab, but it illustrates some of
the mechanics I'd like to get a feel for:

	o  Participation in a team, order or guild is entirely optional.

	o  Internal ladder of positions/offices which can be climbed.
	   Various ways to obtain positions; by vote, appointment, etc.

	o  Positions within group give certain expanded benefits.
	   (Extra reports, ability to appoint other positions, extra
	   commands).

	o  Groups would have certain goals.  Various groups might have
	   conflicting goals, and thus would be natural enemies.

	???
(Good vs. "bad" magic guilds; two competing religions; two or three
competing combat groups; a trade group; a thieves' group.  Heads of
each group vote in the Emperor of Olympia).
