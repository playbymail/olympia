Petty thievery [631]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 631
Time:   seven days

The skill of the common burglar, 631 allows a thief to work a
city for gold.  The thief may pick pockets, steal from merchants
in the market, enter homes in search of loot, or deceive townsfolk
into parting with their gold with confidence games.

631 may only be used in a city, where there are many opportunities
for the petty thief.  Since reports of thievery tend to make the
city residents tense and alert, 631 may only be used once per month
in each city.

A thief will earn between 50 and 150 gold for each successful use of
631.  There is a 5% chance that instead of obtaining gold, the thief
will be caught and beaten, and receive a 5-15 point health loss.

The amount of gold the thief obtains from the city is deducted from
the city's tax base for the month.

Cities which have recently been pillaged offer no opportunities for
petty thievery, as the residents have already been stripped of their
valuables, and are wary of strangers.


Appear common [803]
-------------------
Usage:  USE 803 <aura>

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The caster expends aura to conceal the fact that he is a magician.
Nobles who possess magical powers are identified to others in the turn
reports with a tag:

         max aura        tag
         --------        ---
           6-10          conjurer
          11-15          mage
          16-20          wizard
          21-30          sorcerer
           30+             ??

Use of 803 allows the tag to be suppressed for a number of turns
equal to the amount of aura invested in the cast.

Uses of 803 are addititive.  A mage with 4 turns of concealment
remaining who ordered "use 803 3" would have a total of seven turns
of concealment.
