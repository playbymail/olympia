Combat [610]
------------
The student of combat learns the training of soldiers and how
to lead them well in battle.  With study and experience, the
battle lord will find strategies to be used in difficult combat
situations.

The following skills may be studied directly once Combat is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   611    Survive fatal wound                four weeks
   612    Fight to the death                 four weeks
   613    Construct catapult                 two weeks
   614    Defense                            two weeks
   615    Archery                            three weeks
   616    Swordplay                          two weeks
   617    Weaponsmithing                     two weeks



Survive fatal wound [611]
-------------------------
Usage:   implicit

Knowledge of 611 confers the ability for a noble to survive
a wound which would be normally be fatal.  If the noble's
health reaches zero, either through combat or by other harm,
instead of dying the noble will be restored to full health.

Once the skill has been used, it is forgotten.  To survive
a second fatal would, the noble would have to spend another
Noble Point and study for three weeks to learn 611 again.


Magic [800]
-----------
No apprentice magician can rightfully don the robes of his order without
some knowledge of Magic [800].  Magic contains many spells useful on
their own, as well as in conjunction with spells from the other schools 
of sorcery.

The following skills may be studied directly once Magic is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   801    Meditate                           two weeks
   802    Perform common tasks for gold      two weeks
   803    Appear common                      two weeks
   804    View current aura level of others  three weeks
   805    Reveal abilities of another mage   two weeks

Further skills may be found through research.


Necromancy [900]
----------------
The way of the necromancer leads to fresh graves, the pits of Hades,
and unspeakable horrors found only in dark corners of men's souls.

Power is gained through animation and enslavement of the dead, both
followers as well as nobles.  A necromancer looks upon a bloody
battlefield strewn with the dead as a potential army waiting to be
trained.

Advanced necromancers wield fierce powers, manipulating evil Runes
to effect their will upon the world, and making pacts with demons
to obtain power in return for souls.

With great power also comes great danger, and necromancy is the most
dangerous of the magical arts.  Only those willing to risk death at
the hands of civilized men, or worse fates meted out by demons sent
from the underworld, should even consider its study.

The following skills may be studied directly once Necromancy is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   901    Transcend death                    four weeks, 1 NP req'd
   902    Runes of Evil                      three weeks
   903    Summon ghost warriors              three weeks

Further skills may be found through research.
