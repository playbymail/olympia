Players are intended to learn how Olympia works primarily from
experience with the game, and not by poring over detailed
descriptions of the game mechanisms.  Olympia is not chess; part of
the fun is trying to learn the rules from your experiences.  And like
the real world, Olympia's game mechanisms are complicated and often
mysterious.  It will be difficult for even an experienced player to
accurately predict the outcome of some actions.  So do not complain
about unexpected results unless you have reason to suspect a bug;
accept the game designer's word if he says there is no bug.  And
don't risk everything on something you *think* you understand.  Odds
are it is more complicated than you suspect.


This seems a perfectly good solution to me.  The "story" to justify it
is the same as the "story" as to why gold weighs nothing in Olympia, 
or studying a skill always takes exactly the same amount of time, or why
all people from the smallest to the biggest weigh exactly the same -
these things are all adequate approximations.
