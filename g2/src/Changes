Change d_breed to not allow i1 == i2 && man_item(i1)

inner locs should be randomly numbered

Multiple starting cities:  because you didn't last time.

Pick a larger numbering space for structures
Put a maximum on HOSTILE, NEUTRAL, etc.
Put a maximum on the # of orders a faction will execute.

Separate PRESS command for regular announcements.

Hades and Faery destroy the idea of a frontier, and subvert gatemastery.

Characters that regen in starting cities should appear in random order.
Turn delay between death and regen?


One way to give more variety would be to have the skills you can pick up
from cities be more geographically skewed.  So if you wanted to learn
Necromancy, you could only do it on a certain island.  If you wanted to
learn about Weather Magic, you would have to have a noble half-way around
the world.  This would make gathering all these skills a more challenging task
and would spread factions out a bit, so that a landowner spending all his
noble-days developing his kingdom wouldn't pick up all the skills so quickly.

Should really fix trade somehow.

   >Other things in Olympia need to be changed to allow greater personal
   >growth of "heroic" nobles, but this would be a start.
   
   Yes.  I've suggested that Rich implement *and enforce* space limits on
   internal locations such as hills and graveyards and such.  That way, a
   noble and a large army couldn't enter, only a small band of nobles and
   maybe some fighting men.  This would let Rich better tune monsters to
   require certain types of forces to defeat.

That I completely agree with.  This is both a real problem and the
correct solution.

Must
----

0.  Add secret selling skill.  Should be very easy to add.

1.  Add a new skill to catch beasts in the wilderness.
    It is similar to wild horse catching.

2.  Players may choose from 6-12 cities to start in.

3.  Get rid of o/0 l/1 in ID's.
	Done in engine, what about mapgen?

4.  Design new map for G2

5.  Don't have subloc npc's auto-attack people who enter.

7.  Remove all forms of NP transfer.  Give each player 6 characters from the
    start.  If a character dies, reincarnate it in its starting location.

	a. potion of slavery goes away		XX
	b. form/bribe/honor/oath/terrorize go away	XX
		loyalty desertions		..
		np's at start			XX
		loyalty report			XX
		np accretion			XX
		np report at top		XX
		nps on skills			XX
		curse noncreate loyalty 9113	XX
	c. persuade oathbound noble goes away	XX
	d. rescued npc prisoners		XX

	e. start player with five units
	f. give player a new unit if one dies
	g. give player a command to give up a character
	h. new way to work to get more units (max 9)


3.  ATTACK always takes three days, regardless of whether the target is
    present and engaged or not.  (except for "meta-errors"; see source)

	[or should all commands take their stated amount of time?
	no, too big a change]


Holding fighters idea needs attention to summoned entities, mobs, etc.
Or wait -- is an army stack a stack, or a unit?

Perhaps require Persuasion for RECRUIT.

Perhaps disallow mages to RECRUIT, due to public revulsion.

Maybe?
------

2.  Make all attacks take three days, regardless of success/failure
    (i.e. ATTACK takes 3 days prep even if the target isn't found).

3.  Non-combat stacks that are smaller than a force trying to
    attack them have a 50% chance to evade the agressor.

4.  Flag armies as ", army".  Perhaps require combat (Military leadership)
    to hold military units.


Combat
------

1.  The combat ratings for peasants, sailors and workers is removed.
2.  Only one who has studied Combat may hold fighters.
3.  Only one who has studied Combat may issue ATTACK.
4.  ATTACK always takes 3 days, regardless of whether the target is found.
5.  ATTACK against a non-Combat unit has a 50% chance of failure.
6.  Monsters don't randomly attack travelers.

#4 doesn't work with hostile  (or does it?)

Alt #5:
	Attack against non-combat unit has 20% chance of succeeding in a
	city or province, 50% in a sublocation.

Make it so that subloc npc's aren't hostile

7.  Change to combat system: alternate sides, 4-in-a-row?


How to make defense easier?
	bigger defensive bonus to towers
	extra bonus for defending...
		a skill?
		if you're at home or something?
	forest defense
		bonus if not an attacker and you're at large in the forest
	mountain defense
	plains defense
	swamp defense
	desert defense


POV growth
----------

Players start with five nobles

Each additional noble requires the following investment of time
into SOLICIT.  SOLICIT may only be used by a noble once per month:
SOLICIT/HIRE/ATTRACT.

	noble 	weeks		rl months	components
	-----	-----		---------	----------
	 6th	  20		    1		    5*4
	 7th	  48		    2		    6*8
	 8th	  56	 	    2		    7*8
	 9th	  96		    3		    8*12
	10th	 144		    4		    9*16
	11th	 200		    5		   10*20
	12th	 264		    6		   11*24

wrinkles:
	give 10 weeks credit for visiting 10 cities
	(must add 10 to everything though; feh)

	or make them hurdles, eh?  so to do 6-7 one has to visit 10 cities
	8-9 requires visiting three separate regions
	10-11 requires payment of 50,000 gold.
	11-12 requires rank of duke or higher


Must
----

1.  Add a new skill to catch beasts in the wilderness.
    It is similar to wild horse catching.

2.  Make sure BUILD RAFT is documented.

3.  Players may choose from 6-12 cities to start in.

4.  There are no safe havens. (?)  Players are invisible?
    Safe havens only work for your first three turns?

5.  Combat changes.
	Change combat ratings such that peasants, workers, other free
	soldiers can't fight.  But make sure they run away in combat, too.

6.  Get rid of o/0 l/1 in ID's.
	Done in engine, what about mapgen?



Optional
--------

1.  Improve trade.  Trade should make more than taxes.

2.  Add rivers.

3.  Include chart showing what every kind of fighter, beast is.

4.  Morrow "wimpy" mode

5.  Require Persuasion to recruit



Hmmm
----

Max NP's / nobles per faction.

Powerful NPCs with special treasures




Starting cities
---------------

Don't release the vague map?

Game years to get to the edge of the map

Don't have free turns.  Maybe debit people .50 for a turn they don't run.


2.  Don't have wandering beasties attack automatically.
    Lone nobles should be able to explore.

3.  Get rid of the potion of slavery.

4.  Combat changes:

	a.  When a unit is captured, all men with it desert, all
	    beasts run away.

	b.  A unit that is not captured retreats.  Retreat is a movement
	    out of the province in a specific direction.  The direction to
	    retreat may be specified with the RETREAT order.  The unit may
	    not be attacked while it is retreating.  (Should the unit be
	    invisible?)  As soon as any member of the stack stops moving,
	    it loses its immunity shield.  Retreating units drop 25% of
	    their stuff.

	c.  Some kind of change to make the losers be able to get their
	    licks in.

	d.  Some kind of change to allow a superdragon.

	e.  Add a battle magic phase at the start of combat.

5.  Have the Cloud city float around.  Create a rare artifact to
    control its wanderings.

6.  Have Faery hills float around, instead of having the faery stones

7.  Add a Steal item skill to stealth?

Beastmastery
------------

1.  Improve trade.  Trade should net lots of money.  More than taxes.

1.  Map should be smaller.  500-2500 provinces.


1.  NP's are conserved between factions.

	a.  Potion of slavery goes away.
	b.  New players are given 25 NP's.  No further NP's are ever
	    accumulated.
	c.  TERRORIZE, BRIBE, Persuade oathbound noble require payment
	    of NP's by the aggressor in the event of success.
	d.  Upon death or desertion, all NP's are returned to a noble's
	    owner.

1.  Combat changes, first attempt:

	a.  New combat algorithm:

		1.  All missile fighters get the first round of attacks. 
		    Algorith is as it is now:  choose random victim, see
		    if we hit them.

		    Missile fighters do not fire again during battle.

		2.  Repeat until done:
			Choose a man from each side to fight
			Chance that A hits B is: A / (A + B)
			Otherwise B hits A.

	b.  Eliminate breaking and Fight to the death.  All combat
	    proceeds until every figure on one side has been hit.

	c.  Fog should have effect in combat, just like wind & rain.
	    Wind & rain should affect crossbows & nobles too.

3.  Number of peasants recruitable in a province each month == civ level.
    Recruiting may only be done in cities.

4.  A choice of six initial start cities.  There are no safe havens.
    Instead...  (newbie shields?  invisibility?)

7.  Harvest lumber may only be done instead a lumbercamp.
    Lumbercamps require 500 effort, no materials to create.
    Only one lumbercamp is allowed per forest.

    Quarry stone may only be done in a quarry.
    Quarries require 500 effort, no materials to create.
    Only one quarry is allowed per mountain.

    Lumbercamps and quarries suffer quick damage if left unoccupied.


Other changes
-------------

1.  Consider going to an O3-ish map.  Longer travel times between
    provinces.  Smaller overall number of provinces (200-500).
    All resource extraction takes place in sublocations within
    provinces.  Approx 5-10 sublocs per province.  3 days travel
    into/out of a subloc.  Perhaps a sub-map of inter-subloc routes.

2.  The Cloudlands is replaced with a randomly floating Cloud City.
    Find the key stone which governs the floating so you can direct
    the city yourself.

3.  Big underground dungeon.  Entrances here and there.  Really tough
    dragons down there.

4.  Inland river travel




Setup fee?  $5?  $10?

Longer to travel between provinces.

Winner-gets-weaker combat (see ed bailey mail)

Implement rivers, de-emphasise ocean travel

New-style map?

Get rid of license-plate id's!

Progressive NP costs.  Or a fixed number of core nobles?  Nah, just
progressive NP costs.

Get rid of Use beasts in battle.  Maybe whole beastmastery category.

Better Trade system.

Show toughness of beasts, so one doesn't attack them if one won't win?


Whoa.  One thing we don't want to do is to start getting crazy with
the changes.  We want enough key changes so that the entire _feel_
of the game is different.  New ID scheme, the map idea might do that.
But we want to get G2 off the ground as quickly as possible.


Proposed rule changes
---------------------

1.  Limit Common magic to cities, or tie it to civ level [srt]

> Note that if you adopt Greg's day-by-day PCT4G scheme, this problem
> would disappear. That scheme was that you compute PCT4G on a
> day-by-day basis, allowing everyone trying PCT4G to collect a fraction
> of the available gold, just like peasants or wood or stone or other
> such resources.

2.  Eliminate the diminishing returns on STUDY.
    Instead, characters would be limited to initiating at most
    two STUDY orders per game month.  All STUDY would count for
    full credit, i.e. 1 day's credit for 1 day's study.

3.  Allow GET/GIVE to work across zero time routes.
    Characters could GIVE and item to another character who was
    inside a building.

4.  Allow BUY/SELL/STUDY to work from inside of buildings.

5.  Limit ships to being built in cities.

6.  Instead of Safe Havens, have personal newbie shields.  Last for
    n turns, or until the first ATTACK / HOSTILE / DEFEND.  This lets
    newbies go out and walk around.

    Or at least make ordering random within safe havens.

7.  Install default garrisons in all cities.  100 pikemen or something.
    ADMIT ALL.  PC nobles stacking with the garrisons earn some small
    amount of gold in return for work aiding the city's defense.

8.  Allow a choice of several start cities.

9.  Have a really tough dragon underground somewhere, guarding a
    horde of gold.

10. Look at Bron's sqrt() change to combat side selection, as a
    "walk over" effect reducer.

11. Fog should have effect in combat, just like wind & rain.
    Wind & rain should affect crossbows too.

12. Only allow one building of each type in each location.
    Except towers.  There can be up to six towers in a location.

13. Orders should take constant time whenever possible.  Magic spells
    should take constant time, even for failure -- the time spent
    represents an attempt to cast the spell, even if you don't know it.
    (chance to learn?)  Do everything possible to make predicting the
    turn possible in a rigorous sense, so we can implement a turn
    simulator.

16. Require full term of study in city, not just first day.
    Make a scroll for each common subskill; sell them in the
    city markets.  Require a scroll to learn the common subskills.
    Add [days] to study.

17. Garrison each city by default.  Garrisons are ADMIT ALL.  Players
    who stack with garrisons get paid 5 gold/week.

18. Get rid of resurrection, or make it harder.
    Limit to being used in temples.
    Last Rites is a problem too.

19. Make building castles harder.

20. Make faction growth even slower.  Harder to oath?

21. Allow up to 6 NP and 1200 gold to be spent immediately
    learning skills/developing character right away at setup.

    Setup execution:

	> learn <skill>
	> master <skill>

22. Make the experience scale mean something.  Should take many uses.
    Should display with the character.

	10,25,45,70,100

    Increase amount of wood/etc. which can be harvested.
    Increase ability of sailing, etc.

23. Need a plot.  Call it Olympia G2 -- The Darklands.
    Beyond Olympia:  The Darklands of Areth Pirn.
    Come up with some story about how the sun got dark and evil
    things crawled out of the earth.  The game ends when the last
    vile creature has been killed.

    The player or team with the most ??? when this milestone is
    reached is declared the victor.

    Separate world into areas or islands (nasty forest, underground
    dungeon, etc.)  List how tough the monsters are in each area.
    Start players in a relatively friendly setting.

    Have each different kind of monster have a king, holding a control
    artifact which gives him control of each of his units.

	Orcs Savages Barbarians Skeletons ...

    Dragons are independent.

    No shipcraft, gatecraft.

    Have a ship players can summon for an amount of gold.  It takes
    them into the west, to the land of the dead.  There they must
    defeat skeletons and the undead lord.  There is no return for
    mortals from the land of the dead.

    Also have an underground kingdom with a really tough dragon.

24. Eliminate civ level.

25. New areas, revamp old ones.  Let the cloud city float around;
    have an artifact to control where it goes.

26. Players get a fixed 1-6 primary characters.  Primary characters
    may learn things, do things.  They may HIRE secondary characters,
    and TELL them to do things, but don't get POVs for these other
    units.

27. Mute control artifacts into a new skill which binds a secondary
    character's spirit to the artifact.

28. Let castles be built on islands.

29. Uldim/Summerbridge are a month off.  Should be end of 2-end of 6.

30. Make FLY automatic in MOVE, like riding is.

Rich, 

This is only the second time that I have liked a PBM game enough to
bother writing to the GM/designer with suggestions.

For a _close_ ended game, Olympia is magnificient!  The ability to
quickely create armies and smash other player positions. Excitement
adventure, romance and blood! After only 17 turns, we have had a
major battle on Mt. Olympus!

For an _open_ ended game however, things seem to be moving awesomely
fast. The AOO is dominating Provincia and more than likely each of 
the other landmasses is soon going to have a dominate group. What is 
going to be the fate of someone who starts the game in six months 
from now? I think that things are moving so fast because everything 
is so bloody cheap.

Beastmasters after a minimal IPL are able to wield large forces at
no charge. Silver tongued orators with Persuasion can acquire large
followings of peasants, again at no charge. Even regular trained troops
are dirt cheap. 

If Olympia is meant to be a _closed_ ended game, it would be nice to
post the victory conditions, so that we non-playtestors know what to
aim for. If Olympia is menat to be a _open_ ended game, I have some
suggestions.

 1. Double or even triple the cost of everything. Do not
    change the income, just the cost.

 2. Implement food and require that beasts, peasants,
    soldiers, etc all be fed each turn, just like the
    peasants & soldiers must be paid.

    Other than putting a price on large armies of beasts,
    the food requirement would now enable a force to
    lay siege to a castle and starve out the occupants.

 3. Change the availability of resources in a province
    to be dependant upon the civ level and the season.

    Peasants, for instance, might be more available in
    high civ provinces during winter and summer but 
    less available during the planting/harvest seasons
    of spring and fall and in low civ provinces.

    Food might be more available in summer and fall.

    Horses might be more available in low civ provinces 
    during fall (after the spring foals are grown up).

Thanx for you time,
    Mike McCourt / faction  vm2
    lachlan@netcom.com

BTW: The rulebooks are great.


Combat idea:
	use that alternative we thought of early in combat design
	a vs. b.  either a wins, or b wins.
	missile fighter works traditionally
	each missile fighter gets to shoot during a round
	other fighters are paired up and duke it out...one left standing


Skyships
Deserts are the seas
Arabian Nights
Magic uses up life -- creates desert

more things to mine
	anamentite
	basis of skyships
	liftwood


tired of plain old regular fantasy
fantasy is neat if its different

more advanced fantasy setting -- technology based on magic
vehicles that are magic powered, "soul powered"
necromancers use people's souls as a power source

sand dragons
vast desert "sea" -- but stuff within it

steam powered railroads

mount some kind of reptile like creature, fly, use them as mounts
ships built of liftwood, liftstone

flying fortresses, flying cities made out of the stuff

boarding battles

a lot of detail in the ships.  different sizes, unique things

colonies exist in the game after the players are gone
have players run cities, "run" the city
sim-city like things

powergamers, powermongers want to RUN their cities
build stuff in it, control the market, run everything

outpost settlements slaves mining ores for the cities
farms ranches

technology; cannons, mostly sword based, perhaps very primitive
firearms

BSE: each position can own 6 outposts

colonies produce things
make it so that colony cannot be self sufficient
basically can survive, but to produce things, traders have
to bring it to you

different kinds of ore
pilot gem / crystal for navigation
governor crystal

caravan -- subset of city position
also gives pirates something to hit
build railroads between the cities, run trains
colonies are where research gets done

black market single character position

Midgard: position types are clans (ship, horse based; military
fighting units); and cities; cities do production
charioteers, neat types of siege weapons, 18 troop types

flying cities, moves on as resources are depleted

ground party, groun expedition, "clan"

Underwater game, hi tech, flavor of BSE
underwater colonies
Waterworld

A lot of naval people in PBM
Warships, ships that shoot torpedoes at one another
naval battles, space battles

twin worlds, sister planet, one's water, the other's desert,
gates between them.

valley, magic surrounding it, dense packed forest, very large,
populated with cannibalistic halflings

very salty or acidic ocean in the desert, lot of metal compounds

suck all life into their continent, use it as a power source for
their magic.

flying carpets over the desert too?  they would wear out, of course.

Out Time Days: most detailed cities ever
	text based detailed descriptions

maybe except for Adventurer's Guild


Separate reports for each different kind of position
Individual reports per noble/position/city/etc.

City armies: training, troop marches, drills, etc.
Each up lots of time.

Unit called passengers that you ferry from city to city.


  10.  A small automatic income for each faction.  (an allowance
from the family?)  Avoids having to make pots or write press for
cash needed to support a minimal entourage.

  11.  Have some starting cities on small island continents
where all provinces are safe havens.  No location building
(except perhaps for towers so peaceful types could research
without fear).

  12.  Allow for castles (and income, though small) on islands.
Would not affect balance much, but would be fun.  Perhaps a better
idea is for some one province continent/islands.


Make map long & thin: the inside of a space tube.
Don't make too many gates.  Seal lots of them.



So far, the changes I have for G2 which address the power problem are:

        o  Make defending easier than attacking.
                Example:  Peasants, workers and sailors will not
                participate in attacks, only for defense.

        o  Elimination of winner-gets-stronger in combat.
                Fighters on the opposing side never get added to the
                victor's inventory.  1/3-2/3 of booty is always lost in
                battle.  Lack of NP transfer means you have no chance
                of getting nobles out of an attack.

        o  A slight change to the combat algorithm lets the loser get his
           licks in before he goes down.  This makes combat more expensive
           for the bully, as he can't attack and come away unscathed.

        o  Beastmastery fixed.
                Beasts require workers for maintenance, and aren't
                as plentiful (one has to catch them like horses).

        o  A reduction in castle income.
                Castles still are lucrative, just not as much.

Some others I'm considering:

        o  Making attacks take more time, say 3 days, perhaps even when
           the target is not found.

        o  Improving the flee mechanics, so you actually have a chance to
           get away (although increasing the attack time as above helps a
           bit here).

        o  Bring back "hyperspace" movement, so one can't be attacked after
           the first day of travel out of a province.  This is really just
           making ATTACK and the display routines work like GIVE, STACK, etc.

These are all tuning level fixes.  They will slow the ramp-up of power in the
game, and together with a limit on the number of nobles allowed in a faction,
may be sufficient to make the game stable in the long term.

Some have suggested changes which I mentally classify in the "Club Olympia over
the head" category.  These include "wimpy" and variants, where we draw a sharp
line between combat units and non-combat units, and spotting rules. These are
all swell ideas, but are big changes, and the level of debate they spark
suggests that they really need playtesting to see just how they behave in
practice.  I'm reluctant to embrace these radical changes unless tuning level
fixes can't do the job.

Another thing you might want to consider when making the new g2 map is
to make ALL the lair locations "hidden" except, maybe, islands.  As
people are pointing out, lair cleaning is most lucrative and benefits
those who get in the game first.  As you've pointed out, it is just
too easy to do with an army.  By making them hidden:

A) Players cannot use controlled units to find them, even if artifacts
   only let you control one controlled unit.
B) It will take a longer time to find them all, thus slowing down
   things a bit more (and you want to slow down the game progression).
C) It will make EXPLORE a more valuable command that people will be
   more willing to use more often.  
D) It will partially redress the problem that a roving army can easily
   go on a lair cleaning expedition.  Slowing down an army makes this
   more expensive.

Best of all, you should be able to do this with the exiting game.

The next change I'd make is to make it so that books are destroyed
when used to learn a skill.  This will remove the problem of players
finding more and more books with none of them ever going away.  It
will also make people less willing to share them.

Another change you might want to consider is to REALLY limit the
skills that each city teaches and restrict all magic skills EXCEPT the
basic Magic skill (and Weather Magic in the Cloud Cities) to books
that must be found or maybe to books and just one or two cities in the
world.  Other skills should be harder to find.  Each city should only
teach one or two skills, not a half dozen.  This will encourage people
to go out and explore.  Imperial City might be an exception, teaching
Combat, Shipcraft, Forestry, Stealth, Magic, and Gatecraft -- all the
skills you might need to get started (including Stealth so you CAN
sneak out of IC if you want).  The rest might teach only one or two
skills.

What do you think?

 Especially opium dealing as an attack upon a taxing lord's realm.  I noticed
that nobody was selling opium on the recent money report.  

    If this skill were to make thieves too powerful, perhaps we could develop
another skill to track thieves, thus bringing counter-intelligence to the

Use of this skill allows a thief to buy and sell items on the market
anonymously.  Buy and sell orders will appear publically as "a fence" or
something like that.

In G2, siege engines used on DEFENSE should target siege engines by

lots of catapults and using them against the enemy ones...

I sort of like the ability to use garrisons to store stuff.  What's

What happens to the inventory when you UNGARRISON?

This is better although I think warmount is still too hard.  But maybe

I'm going to miss the coastal routes.  I sort of liked those.  Maybe
have coastal waters (adjacent to land), and deep ocean, and make travel

run into people.

Subject: Garrison problem redux
Status: RO


Last turn I mentioned that a garrison with troops having
a total maintenance of 272 gold in a wilderness province
didn't suffer any attrition.  That, I thought, was an
obvious bug.  This turn I attacked the garrison and it
had 252 gold that I captured!  I just don't believe that
Ergonal put his gold in a garrison for safe keeping.
There is something very wrong going on here and it may
well be that some players have been abusing this bug
for fun and profit.  Viliz has apparently garrisonned
300+ troops in a civ-1 province this turn ([by10]).
Since you can TAKE stuff from garrisons in zero time
UNGARRISON may be a useless command.  I don't know,
maybe the empty garrison stays around until the end
of the turn...  If you garrisonned on the last day
of the month and then took everything from the garrison
at the start of the next month, you may never be at
risk from a surprise attack and never have to spend
any money!  Anyhow, I think there's a problem...

The Survive Fatal Wound was demonstrated as an essentially
useless skill this turn.  I was able to kill Ergonal no
problem.  He escaped the first time, as you mentioned but
was easily killed the following turn.  I can't think of
many situations where the skill would actually help.  I
think you may want to change the mechanics so that the
noble is moved to the nearest GY alive or back to IC
alive.  Those changes are probably going too far though.
It's certainly not worth an NP IMO though.

The ability of powerful players to use Faery as a superhighway to
quickly get anywhere sort of undermines the ability of players to use
distance to get away from the enemy. Remember when I said that a
fantasy game was one in which it took a long time to cross the world,
whereas a space game was one in which you could cross the entire
universe in 3-4 turns? Well, for most players Oly is fantasy, but for
a few, it's a space game. Hades doesn't really have this effect
because of the fees, although I think that beasts don't get charged,
right? so it's still a bit weird.

------------------------------------------------------------------
The Aethelarn Convention on Civilized Warfare 0.1
=================================================

Olympia is a warlike world, ridden by strife and ruled by warlords willing  
to use violence to achieve their objectives noble and ignoble.  And as some  
of us have made clear, we would not want it any other way.  That being said,  
it is still true that there are certain means of warfare which seem to  
inflict much greater harm on the victim than aid the victimizer or otherwise  
detract from the general enjoyment of wanton bloodshed.  We have acted on the  
basis of an unspoken Gentlemans Agreement that such means were to be  
avoided.  Regrettably it has been shown that such agreements aren't always  
sufficient.  Hence we propose the following articles.

(A1) Ban on the aggressive use of Laying to Rest.

Aggressive Laying to Rest of killed enemy nobles to deprive their allies of  
the opportunity to resurrect them is clearly a legal tactic.  Equally clearly  
by statements of the Great God Atnerks it was a wholly unintended one which  
basically eliminates the possibility of resurrection in those cases in which  
it would be most useful i.e. all the major Olympian leaders.  Signatories  
agree not to engage in it or to solicit others to engage in it against nobles  
associated with other signatories.

(B1) Becoming a signatory.

Any noble leading a group of other nobles may become a signatory by  
personally POSTing to the Olympian Times.  A list of other nobles also  
covered by the agreement is optional.  A noble may indicate that he has  
signed this convention or is bound to it by a superior nobles signing of it  
by stating "ACOCW" anywhere in their banner.

(B2) Violations.

A signatory may accuse another signatory of violating this convention in a  
POST to the Olympian Times containing as much corroborating detail as  
possible.  After such a POST the convention is suspended between the accuser  
and the accused until they mutually agree to reinstate it.

I attach my signature to this agreement and consider myself bound by it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What do you think ?  Is it a bad idea ?  Would you sign it ?  Violate it ?

Cc: AOO list <aoo-list@cedman.remote.Princeton.EDU>
Reply-To: cedman@Princeton.EDU
Status: RO

Apropos nothing at all let me once again point out just how broken the  
current handling of death in Olympia is.  It has all kinds of unrealistic,  
counterintuitive and generally un-fun consequences:

Most of all, Lay to Rest has become the most widely used offensive spell in  
the game.  Anybody, anywhere can do it and destroy a body even if they  
weren't involved in the events leading to the death at all, even if the side  
of the dead body won the confrontation.  Even if you recover the body  
instantly and start resurrecting it at the highest possible speed, it is  
completely impossible to beat a determined LTRer to the punch.

One counterintuitive consequence of this is that Resurrection really applies  
only to minor characters.  If a character isn't worth laying to rest, he is  
probably only barely worth resurrecting.  But powerful or famous characters  
which a seasoned role-player would consider the prime candidates for  
resurrection never get a chance against an opponent with an IQ above room  
temperature.

On the other hand losing any number of those common fear/contract nobles  
with only a few skills has almost no cost at all.  Even if you have no access  
to the body, you can have it laid to rest, used the NP to form a new noble,  
have it study combat and be out recruiting or training again within a month.

Even worse is the horrible lack of realism of death itself.  When a noble  
dies on the battle field, he doesn't just lay down in the dirt as one would  
expect.  Instead he wrangles free from all his opponents without a problem,  
sprouts a pair of wings and flies to the nearest graveyard at a velocity  
greater than that of a speeding nazgul.  Then he buries himself but not  
before sending a telegram to his old boss so that he knows where he can find  
him when he needs him.

With all due (and considerable) respect for you, Rich, this system sucks.   
It is broken so badly that as we have found out any attempts to fix it by  
twiddling with the parameters is likely to only make it worse.  What it needs  
is a complete bottom up replacement.  Of course this can't be done in G1,  
but here is what how I think death should work in G2.

When a noble dies, his body is handled the same way his items are currently  
i.e. if he is in a stack, somebody in the stack inherits the body.  If he  
dies in battle, the body ends up either with the winners, his own side if  
there are some escapees, or hidden in the province.  If a single noble dies  
all by himself his body always ends up hidden in the province.  Hidden bodies  
can be found like any other items by using explore.  A year after the death  
the body is destroyed.  If the body is destroyed either by the passage of  
time or e.g. having its brain eaten, it is just gone.  The old owner receives  
back neither a NP, nor does he even get a message.

A priest in a graveyard who holds a body can lay it to rest.  That destroys  
the body, but recovers all invested NPs for the old owner.  A priest in a  
temple who holds a body can resurrect it.  Resurrection restores the body to  
life under its old ownership but it costs the faction of the priest a NP.   
Together these rules should ensure that only the most powerful nobles are  
resurrected.  Resurrection would be rare and impressive.  Most mortals stay  
dead, but if their owners can recover the bodies and have them laid to rest  
within a year they won't suffer permanently, apart from the hassles involved  
in the laying to rest.

As a side note, under this system high power aura blasts are downgraded from  
killer strategy to mere major nuisance as the body of the aura blasted noble  
will typical end up in the ownership of its allies in the old stack.

Status: RO

I disagree almost 100% with Carl's ideas of how to "solve" the problem,
but I pretty much agree with him that the whole death/prisoner/last
rites system is a lousy one.

One thing I would add is that Survive fatal wound is the oddest of
things: a very expensive skill (1 NP!) which has *negative* value.  I
just attacked a couple of nobles with SFW this past turn.  Because of
their SFW, instead of being dead, they are my prisoners at health 100.
Which is clearly worse for their owner: if I want, I can always execute
them, but I also have other options like Persuade oathbound noble, or
just keeping them prisoner forever.

Anyway this whole skill makes zero sense and I know I'd be mad if I had
foolishly expended any NP on it.

I just got burned *again*, because a friend of mine couldn't move into

The lore sheet for Dispel location shroud is a little nebulous.


Dispel location shroud [9143]
-----------------------------
Usage:  USE 9143 <location>

Required aura:  three points
Required item:
Time to cast:   three days

Dispels any magical shroud inhibiting scrying of the specified
location.


This sounds like you can sit safely ensconsed in your private tower, and 
just blow away any location shroud in the world with just three aura and
three days.  Is this correct?

Um, ok.  Well, location shrouds are pretty wimpy then.  Are you going to 
change this to look like the create magical barrier/remove magical barrier
things, and if so, when?

>I probably just won't have Faery in G2...

Oh, I don't think most players want that.  Faery is cool, after all.
It's just (as Greg rightly points out) too easy to abuse as a
shortcut.

Cutting down on the number of elfstones would be one solution
(especially if you remove the apparent automatic protection NPC units
get).  And from my limited experience it seems like the Hunt doesn't
attack that often.  Make them more vicious.  Add 2 elves to the Hunt
for every body that enters Faery. Give the Hunt control over all the
beasts in the battle.  After all, an elf versus a beastmaster?  Who is
the dragon going to obey? :-)

Maybe one of the best things to do would be to make travel in Faery
probablistic.  I'd lean towards a mechanism that shuffles the
connections between the Faery hills, and maybe even shuffling the hill
on every continent between different enchanted forests.  Or, in
keeping with traditional stories about Faery, you could have the
actual Faery locations shuffle around.  It was notoriously hard to
find your way around, you know.  Everything was constantly shifting.
Maybe in Faery you can only move with directions, and every move
shifts all the location connections?  That would be
weird/cool/vicious.  Also, Faery was typically easier to get into than
out of; maybe elfstones permit you to *leave* Faery...

And you should probably eliminate garrisoning in Faery (and Hell and
the Cloudlands for that matter).  I mean, who exactly are you making
money off of in those places anyway, right?

>...beastmastery is already dealt with.

Are you going to charge maintenance?  That's the obvious solution, but
I lean towards a different kind of limit.  Maybe there's a limit to
the number of beasts a beastmaster can control?  And some way he can
slowly raise that?

It would be cool, too, if you had beasts track their ages, so after
breeding you end up with a "young wyvern" that becomes a "mature
wyvern" that becomes a "young dragon" that becomes a "mature dragon",
etc.  Although you'd still have to speed up aging for game purposes.

Some possible changes (for Olympia II v2) might be:

1. Faery can only be exited where it was entered (i.e., if I entered at
   aa01, and you entered at bb05, when I exit, I will exit at aa01, and
   you will exit at bb05, even if we use the same exit point from the 
   inside. This fits some classic behavior of the faery lands--though
   it doesn't fit them all.

   This solves the armies travelling VIA faery, but not the takeover OF
   faery.

2. Exit from Faery takes time; perhaps a month or so is 'lost' for every
   week spent inside, perhaps with some random component tossed in. In other
   words, whenever a unit tries to *exit* faery, that unit is in 'limbo'
   for a non-deterministic period of time; consuming no food, making no
   income, etc. This fits some other classic behaviors of the faery lands
   (stay overnight, and leave 20 years later...). If kept to a low but not
   trivial value this would reduce the in-out-in-out casual use of faery, 
   and minimizes the use of it as an army transport mechanism.

3. Make the exit points random rather than fixed. Just because the Faery
   know how to get in and out reliably doesn't mean that everyone with
   an elfstone does. In other words, just because exiting from faery in
   this location gets you to aa99 this time, doesn't mean it will always
   do so. (Or, risking a long term problem, make the exit locations
   time dependent: day of week, or season, or month, or such.)


All of these keep the extra 'space' available for exploration and conquest,
but do not permit that extra space to become a vehicle for other game
distortions.

The question is: what is the *real* strength of beasts?  When running
the combat simulator (version 1.5) 1 dragon is roughly equivalent to
11 soldiers.

Although though the attack ratio is 500/500 vs. 55/55 the odds are
reported as even.  I think this has to do with the fact that the
dragon has only a 1 in 12 chance of gaining the initiative and must do
so 11 times to win (assuming fight to the death).  The soldiers will
get in a fairly large number of attacks before they die.

If anything, the combat system should be modified to IMPROVE the
performance of strong units.  There is not much of an incentive in the
game to produce swordsmen and knights because the combat system favors
numerical advantage over strength.

I agree that there is an economic advantage to beasts.  One possible
solution is to require a noble-point for beastmastery like magic
skills.  That would at least limit the number of beast masters.
Possibly, also require a noble point for breed beasts.

The older players indeed have serious advantage, but hey, why do we play 
this games if not to overcome challenges.  Sure, I would have loved to 
test my skills on an even playing field against the group of older 
players, and perhaps someday I will, but at the same time success will be 
sweet indeed if I can overcome the inherent disadvantages that "newbies" 
have in Olympia.  I'm not going to brag about my acomplishments here, but 
let's just say that at some point I expect to be able to present at least 
a major annoyance to anyone I choose to annoy, no matter how established. 
Success in a game like Olympia is based on the skill of the player, not 
when he/she starts.  

Not to say that there aren't problems with Olympia, but noble points, 
IMHO, aren't one of them.  That system works for me.  Much worse is that 
a noble with 10,000 dragons can enter an Inn...  ;-)

Seriously, Rich, if you're reading this, my biggest problem is that 
access to the areas where advanced magic can be learned are so easily 
restricted.  That, I think, is the major advantage the older players 
have, and it isn't fair.  Either it should be harder to restrict access 
to Faery and the Cloudlands, or the magic skills taught there and only 
there should be made available in other locations.

Both of those changes turn beasts into more of a specialty item, not
the backbone of your army, restoring human armies to the center of
combat power...

I actually don't like the 1-worker/1-beast thing; that makes it
impossible to have small, powerful, fast-moving beast armies. I
suppose you added more flying cargo capability so that giant birds and
the like can still move with flying units...

Getting on the "growth curve" early wouldn't have been the only
workable strategy if Olympia didn't have so many ways around its
movement restrictions.  Another viable option would have been to
travel and then grow.  The only problem is that those of us who 
tried that quickly found the large alliances pulling in units all
around us from Faery and Hades, cleaning out the surrounding inner
locations that we *would* have time to exploit otherwise.

When a game has useful restrictions to an activity (e.g. movment
times, unit upkeep costs) but then provides tricks to totally get
around those restrictions (Faery, zero upkeep beasts), the players who
most quickly and effectively exploit the tricks win and a player who
can't or doesn't exploid them can't.  While it isn't unreasonable to
give players an advanage for efficient play (e.g. the coastal crawl)
or for things they have developed over time (e.g. most magic, castle
defensive bonuses), it is unreasonable to provide advantages that
totally break restrictions that are important for balancing the game
(e.g. very rapid movment via Faery, teleportaion of 200 dragons to a
prowler in a catle, blasting a noble to death from afar, getting a
half-dozen controlled units from one lair [fixed]).  In short, if
the game -- ANY game -- has restrictions to activities, care needs
to be taken to make sure that those restrictions can't be totally
circumvented by something else in the game.  If so, the game quickly
becomes a situation of "haves" and "have nots".

Is there *really* any virgin territory out there?  Having seen how
quickly little friends popped of of Faery all around us (we were about
as far from IC as you can get) when they wanted to (e.g. when we
attacked them first they had no trouble finding and sieging our
castle, when they thought there were empty castles on Torba Bacor for
them to take [RAZEd in time, thank you very much], when they wanted to
clean out lairs on lands around us [5 to 10 little armies with no
ships -- hmmmm], etc.), I'm dubious of any claims of "frontiers" in
Olympia any more.  You would really need to explain to me how a large
alliance with control of much of Faery, with armies waiting there,
with the ability to Scry or Vision any noble they see start in IC, and
with the ability to either blast nobles from afar or teleport in
hundreds of dragons to a hiding prowler would have any problem wiping
out any new player they want to.  Oh, joining up with another alliance
might prolong things but can anyone in a certain large alliance really
say, with a straight face, that if they wanted a particular faction
dead that they couldn't do it -- particularly a new one?

Hi Rich


	Sorry to say, but I too will be leaving Olympia.  My reasons for 
leaving are several, but they are all based on my perception that the 
game has not developed in an open-ended fashion.  It has become evident 
to me that the 'power-gamers' of the AOO have in all respects, won the 
game.  I feel that in an open ended game this should not be possible.  

	Some of the flaws in the game as I see them are:

1.	There should be several roads to 'power' , such that no one path 
is far superior to any other.  In this case, the role or importance of 
beastmastery is far greater than that of magic or army-building.  I think 
a proportional balance of power between beastmastery, army building, or 
magic wielding would ensure a greater game balance.

2.	The style of game-play espoused by some members of the AOO ( and 
others I'm sure)  essentially revolves around the 'Harvest of Souls', ie 
acquisition of nobles by preying on new players.  Anyone who cares to 
follow this path of play can rapidly (in fact in an exponential manner) 
outgrow all other factions.  This assumes several things, such as a 
sufficiently large alliance, and a lack of organized counter-reprisal, 
and a reasonably intelligent strategy.  Given that the AOO started the 
game as a large metafaction, and that some of their players were 
undoubtedly very clever, the outcome has been predictable.
	The harvest of souls is the core of the problem.  I have nothing 
against the ability of people in this game to form factions as large as 
they want. But the ability to grow at a rate proportional to the rate of 
loss of other factions means the game is not open ended.  A possible fix 
would be add a combat subskill, 'Death before Dishonour', such that a 
captured noble with this subskill would die before allowing himself to be 
bribed or persuaded.  Another fix might be to simply have multiple start 
locations in the world, although that would reduce the interest of 
exploration.  Maybe periodically rotate start locations to new continents.

3.	My third major nit to pick is the limitation of certain skills 
and resources.  We found that despite settling and exploring 3 or 4 
continents, our faction only found a source for learning scrying around 
turn 55,  and never found any dragons at all.  Maybe we missed something 
fundamental ( ie experimenting with breed beasts more) but as it has 
turned out, we cannot even affect what the AOO does.  It has been pointed 
out that many of the rarer magical skills were to be found in various 
tomes, and that information could be acquired through negotiation, but 
given political uncertainties, it is difficult to make serious inquires 
publically.  While rare skills should be rare, they should also remain 
accesible.
	Also the ability of the AOO, through sheer strength of numbers, 
to be able to control Faery and some of Hades, is unbalancing.  This 
however is a spin-off of Whine #2.  I think however that Hades and Faery 
should remain uncontrollable by anyone at any time, and in fact remain 
dangerous.  Traditional legend/folklore has mortals becoming enchanted or 
entranced if they remained in faery especially if they ate and drank 
while in faery lands.  In game terms, any troops would suffer 10% / week 
losses while in faery, and each noble a 10% flat chance per month of 
being entranced and becoming independent.  Similarly, in Hades, troops 
that drink from the river Lethe would fall alseep never to re-awaken, and 
some due to the sheer horror of being in the Land of the Dead, become 
depressed and wander off to die.  In both cases ( Faery and Hades)  
having large stack especially lingering for a time, would be bound to 
attract the attention of the respective Lords and/or Ladies of the 
Domain, and earn their wrath.  Attacks could be made somewhat 
proportional to the size of the stack

	Relative strengths
'Good guys'								
Native defense
1 noble + 10 soldiers						50%
1 noble  20 soldiers, 10 pikemen,10 crossbowmen		75%
5 nobles 40 soldiers 20 swordsmen, 20 archers, 20 beasts	100% 
5 nobles100 soldiers, 150 crossbowmen, 200 beasts		125%

This kind of an increasing response to increasing forces would keep the 
numbers down, and allow even newbies to explore and travel, while being 
able to survive the trip.  I think allowing Faery and Hades to be used as 
risky routes is good,adding uncertainty to the game, but allowing one 
faction to control one or both regions is game-unbalancing.	

	Despite my criticisms of the game Rich, it is and remains a 
unique experience in game playing.  I have enjoyed both this game and the 
test game immensely.  The ability to conduct diplomatic negotiations is 
great.  The interaction with the other players has been terrific - in 
fact what I enjoyed the most.  The style that we wished to play has 
proven to be non-viable in this game.  We had envisioned MAFOC 
establishing a power base, and acquiring mages, beasts and armies and 
then constantly tweaking the collective noses of the game leaders.  What 
has happened has shown that this is not possible.  Even if the AOO didn't 
have teleporting dragon armies, with the sheer number of nobles they 
possess would eventually swamp all others.  I believe some game tweaks 
are neccessary to maintain the game as open-ended.  If you do start a g2, 
I would love to play again, and as Dan has said I would also be willing 
to throw my $.02 any time.  

				Best of luck

The key to a successful G2 is not that it gives everyone a chance to
start at the beginning.  If that is the only reason for it, then G2
will soon suffer the same fate a G1 if people find it hard to start
after a few turns.  Not very "open ended".  Remember -- this is an
evolving situation with new players all the time and the game should
try to support that.  Otherwise, Olympia will be just another
closed-ended game.

The valid reason for a G2 is to fix the problems that have shown up in
G1 which should, ideally, make the game more equitable and challenging
for all.  The reason that G1 cannot be retrofitted any more than it has
been is that players who have staked their positions on the broken bits
will have their positions destroyed by any fixes.  That isn't really
fair to those players.  G2 would provide the oppotunity to make fixes
and adjust the map to hopefully provide a more balanced game.

As for roads -- fast travel is BAD.  If you can quickly get from point
A to point B, so can everyone else, including your enemies.  Part of
the problem with the AOO is that they aren't just a Provinia problem
(which would be reasonable) but a *global* problem thanks to Scry,
Vision, Teleportation, Faery, and Hades.  If the wilderness isn't hard
to get to (for some reason), it doesn't stay a wilderness for long.
Being able to pinpoint and get to someone (with an army, no less) in
the wilderness in a few short months is a real problem.  Roads will
only make that worse.  I'd personally like to see a map of more
smaller continents although that would require a lot of new names. :-)

>What does the rest of the community think?

What I'd like to know is how many G1 players would jump to G2 and
*stop playing* in G1 and how many would play both?  The reason I ask
is that I think that the people who have spent a lot of time on G1
might get a bit annoyed if everyone jumps to G2 and leaves them in a
dead game.  One could argue that that is what you get for trying to
"win" in an "open-ended" game but I'm still curious. :-)

I think that both games *could* be viable side-by-side, each offering
something a bit different.  But I'd like to know what others think.

Thanks.  Just keep all that in mind when you do the final G2 mods :-).

I think the key is to make it tough for people to shuttle large armies
around and making it a bit more iffy to see at a distance (maybe a
more significant chance of failure for Scry and Vision).  Parhaps
Hades or Faery could work if they only allowed a lone noble in without
troops.  I also had an interesting idea for Hades -- make the prereq
for entry a dead noble and the NP doesn't come back... :-)

John Morrow

BTW - I think the G2 map should be more intricate -- more little
islands, rougher coasts in spots, more significant mountain ranges.
You also might want to consider more stuff like Summerbridge and
the Pass -- and perhaps a sea straight that works like that, too
(perhaps a monthly "high tide"/"low tide" cycle).

Let me add my 2cents about fixing beastmastery.  IMHO, special
months to breed does not solve the game imbalance.
 As a faction with a
fairly large breeding program I would simply adjust to make sure
that my beastmasters had a variety of animals.  Depending upon the
month, I would adjust breeding orders. Dragon breeding now can not
be a monthly occupation but so what?  I still "maximize" my beast
stack and have units that are much more powerful than "human" units.
Again, it takes at least 4 days to create either
 swordman/archer/pikeman
(and more for advanced units such as knight/elite a./elite g.).
These units require maintanence and, because they require
 multiple kinds of inputs (peasants, raw wood/iron, 
processed material, soldiers), it is
often difficult to insure 100% efficiency and coordination

In contrast, to breed beasts takes between 4 and 6 days, requires
little/no coordination, and no maint.  Also no known defesenses
(i.e. wind) to reduce the combat effectiveness of beast armies.
Simply put, except for the ego gratification regarding "men" I see
no reason why mid and old age factions spend _any_ time creating
human armies when they can spend time breeding beasts.  While the
"fodder" argument might hold, I have yet to see a "fodder" dedicated
group of nobles to significantly
ooutpace giant bird/giant spider production over the
long haul.

Hiding the days in which breeding works for particular beasts
hurts newbies and smaller
alliances much more than large ones.  Assuming equal intellengence
leaks", big/old alliances are able to have all their beastmasters
"cover" all beasts each month.  At the end of the cycle they should
know which months allow breeding which beast and which do not.
All this means is that such information becomes valuable and is
unlikely to be shared (it also means that I would kill all
unidentified nobles in beastbreeding area without asking questions
as they can interprete their reports and gain such info).  In
contrast, the smaller alliance has a difficult time "covering" the
possible combinations and so losses breeding opportunites.


IMHO, the best and least intrusive
 "fix" to the beastmastery problem in G2 is to make
beastmastery cost a noble point.  It is a skill that is as valuable
as most of the 1 point magic areas (though I think weather should be
2 but that is a different subject).  It would be difficult except
during the very late game to create 200+ dragon armies _EXCEPT_ if
you specialized in the skill early on.  IMHO, specialization breeds
cooperation/diplomacy which is a very good thing.

In contrast, the fix Rich mentioned early on, requiring support by
way of "workers to handle the beasts" I have decided is a poor fix.
It means that beastmastery _has_ to be associated with castle
ownership (thus reducing the incentives to specialize).  My guess is
that this change will result is fewer "early game" vacuum cleaning
beastmasters (as they will not have the $ to support the peasants)
but that late comers now _have_ to gain castle income to support
beastmastery (thus making it even more difficult to for newbies in a
world in which all land is claimed (and ownership rights enforced by
armies able to move large distances).

You should probably ask Stan, then, for the raw files for the logo he
did so you have it.  Giving graphics a consistent style doesn't mean
you have to toss everything.  My pages look pretty "consistent"
because I cropped and resized all the little graphics icons down to a

Hypermail?  What does it index on?  Everything?  Have you seen the
"DejaNews" site (there is a pointer on my search page)?

As for the manual, are you going to maintain seperate rulebooks for G1
and G2 since, I assume, there are going to be some rules differences
or do you hope to handle most differenes via lore sheets?

Another thing to consider which I touch upon in a recent post -- limit
access to lairs to forces of only a certain size so that people will
never get a 100% chance to kill the monster.  If a noble can only
bring 25 other men along, better human units will have more utility
and lairs will have more of the feel that I think you are shooting
for.  The access limit would probably have to be visible.  You could
also turn this back on for buildings.  If people can fit huge armies
into the castle, it will require them to have a second noble hang 
around as a field general.

	I certainly agree & view it a shame that the game seems to have a 
kind of cold war mentality (e.g. dogmatix et. al v. AOO).  It is too bad 
that the most poweful AOO factions seem to play the game as a closed 
game.  To put it bluntly, some very powerful AOO factions are not 
civilized.  In a society, groups like this are punished & removed as 
sources of irritation (much like the Brotherhood of the Black Dawn was 
earlier in Olympia).  In Olympia, this kind of play is rewarded (captured 
nobles & control artifacts, captured troops, castles, brain-eating, etc.) to 
such an extent that the AOO just dominates everything.  

	I don't mean to say that this isn't a legitimate playing 
style, it is & maybe I'll play G2 that way, who knows?--but it seems that 
the game rewards it too generously.  It was disheartedning to say the least, 
to find big & very unfriendly AOO armies roaming about the frontier in search 
of newbie fodder.  It adds a little too much cynicism to the game & I 
think recent posts here & in the Times reflect that.  Changes in G2 should 
address this problem.  Here are three suggestions:

1. get rid of the eating of the brains thing.  combined with farcast aura 
blasts & rapid transit through hades to the appropriate graveyard 
presents a significant bonus for the first person to wrench five mithril 
out of the ground.

2. make it harder to convert nobles over from one faction to another (I 
haven't really thought out how to do this).

3. stop putting nobles as treasure in lairs.  This just makes looting the 
ruins way too powerful & is what enables the "vacuum effect" & 
exponential growth (1 lair cleaner turns into 2, turns into 4, turns into 8).

Never.  Or at least only over BtAs cold dead body.  Nobody outside the AOO
has ever acquired Advanced Sorcery and lived.  Matter of fact, it was only
last month that the second mage rose to the rank of advanced sorcerers
(with BtAs blessing).  I hope that gives something to think about to those
otherwise usually well-informed nobles who, when the first auraculum was
forged almost five olympian years ago, couldn't help themselves but had to
make jokes about "premature auraculation".

	Even if only nobles were able to transit between games, and were
	stripped of all accompanying creatures (and presumably items, as
	well), that doesn't solve the problem.  Assume everyone other than
	AOO abandoned G1 for the new realm G2 (starting anew over there),

	own defences are tight.  Take away that restriction and they really
	can grown without any limits, drip feeding nobles over into the new
	game as they become powerful enough to be lords in the new realm.

	I'd prefer to see radical changes in g1, things like the earthquakes and
	such that were mentioned many months ago in this very forum.  Such a 
	change could be accomplished as the result of some kind of quest proposed
	by the gods, and would thus give the wicked AOO something to concentrate
	on (stopping) other than killing off newbies (who knows, the dark gods 
	that the AOO worships, may have some kind of quest that is set to them), 
	Even the AOO has limited resources.  Twenty or thirty players cannot take 
	on the other one hundred and fifty odd players indefinitly.

	On the subject of changes, I think a new gatemastery spell to locate the
	far side of gates would be a worthwhile addition.  It would be nice to
	have some way of researching new spells and skills.

	I think it would be good if only a priest in a slain noble's
faction had the ability to perform Last Rites on that noble. Better
yet, you could expand the group to include factions that were on the
noble's ADMIT list when he died. 
	The reason for this is that with the current design, we have
people shutting down their enemies' nobles with Last Rites following
up a battle (or an aura blast.) As well as being very silly, it is too
easy for people to siphon off the serious investments of other
players. I'd like to see Olympia move more in the direction where
there's a fair chance of knocking someone down, but it's difficult to
knock someone out.

I'm glad to hear that more experienced players also have reached the
same conclusion.  I thought I might be missing something.  It appears
that pikemen and crossbowmen/archers *are* sort of optimal given
limited noble time and a game system that favors length over strength
(at least according to the battle simulator which could be incorrect).
This means that a significant number of skills are less than useful
(mining, for example).  It is also a disincentive to trade for scarce
resources (wood and peasants are plentiful; horses and iron less so).

It is interesting that you point out that in Hades where there is a
limit on the number of men stronger units are useful.  Maybe a similar
limitation (number of men in a single stack) would help outside Hades?  

Another idea is to allow Knights to act as independent units sort of
like NPCs with a *very* limited set of orders (move, attack, explore,
seek, etc.)  Combine this with the idea of limiting the number of men
in a stack that can participate in an attack and you add depth to the
game.

While I have no use for riding-speed humans, I could imagine that
others do. If there were an area, like Hades but with no teleport
loophole, where you were limited in the number of humans you could
bring in, then there would be more incentive to build stronger humans.
For right now, I don't build much more than pikemen myself; they're
great at providing a hard-to-kill target for enemy fodder. One
memorable combat between Dogmatix and BtA's army resulted in Dogmatix
losing almost no men because BtA's huge army of savages couldn't get
through Dogmatix's front line of pikemen. So there are some nice
trade-offs in the current game, but the expensive humans aren't really
viable options.

	Nice point, I hadn't though of it that way.  Maybe better than putting
	an absolute stack limit would be putting in a limit of men/beasts per
	noble?  Hopefuly there would be some kind of skill that would let this
	be increased slowly (using current experience system).

	Maybe I should rephrase that.  Nobles should be able to have as many
	men/beasts/whatever in their inventory as they like, but they should
	only be able to _use_ a certain number of them.

	Bad move!
	This lets big factions grow much much faster.  Your nobles produce
	lots of knights who get go and scout out where the interesting places
	are.

	As I'm on this thread anyway, I had may as well put forwards my wish list
	for Game 2.

	1: Roads.  Back when the olympia-discussion list was running I put in a
		proposal for roads.  I guess Rich has it archived away somewhere.
		I'd like to see some sort of roads able to be built.  On the 
		subject of building roads, why is it knowledge of construction
		allows people to build towers/temples/inns/etc without learning
		specific sub skills.  Castle building for instance should probably
		be subject to RESEARCH.  That one simple change would have slowed
		down the AOO in G1.
	2: Limits on beastmastery.  Personally I like the 'in season' idea, but
		whatever.  Beats USED in battle should not be able to be CAPUTRED
		in battle.  (this might already be the case but I don't think it
		was origionally).
	3: Experience should make a bigger difference in mining.  Currently it
		does the regular shortening of days.  I think a grand master miner
		should be able to pull more iron/gold/mithril/whatever from a
		mine than an apprentice should.  Maybe not much more, but there 
		should be a difference.
		Actually, experience should make a bigger difference in most skills,
		at the moment the only skill I can think of where experience makes
		any difference (other than time taken to use the skill) is in
		detecting gates.  Now I don't know all the skills in the game, I do
		know 53 of them however (4th place for those interested).  I use
		only a very small subset of those skills.  Other people with a
		little more experience might want to prove me wrong here.
	4: Religions, How about priests having skills specific to their religion?
		Religion is really a pretty understated part of Olympia at the
		moment, priests are just mages with different spells who don't
		have to worry about aura.  More priestly spells and limits on
		which ones you can learn based on the religion you belong to.
	5: Magic.  Gatemastery seems to be virtually unused.  With the dreaded
		AOO occuping both hades and Faerie I guess this might change,
		but at the moment at any rate gatemastery seems to be a very 
		second rate school of magic.  Having been looking for gates from
		the start of the gate, and exchanging data with over twenty other
		players, I know of 27 different gates.  While I guess there are
		some people out there who know more than me, I think I'm probably
		pretty near the top in gate knowledge.  Yet people don't actually
		USE the gates (as far as I know).  Small steps like reducing the
		amount of aura it takes to use a gate might help here, I don't know.
	6: Skills.  I think it would be neat if cities only taught a single skill.
		Thus in order to know about combat and forestry and mining and
		stealth a noble would be forced to visit at least four different
		cities.  This makes travel and exploration much more important.
		Putting limits of those old books so they deteriate after a while
		and have a chance of falling to pieces would also be a good move.
	7: Wagons.  Another proposal from way back.  A wagon would behave much
		as does a ship, but on land rather than the sea.  This allows
		one noble to concentrate on the movement, while others can work
		on things like study.  I can't remember who came up with this idea
		either, but I like it.

	Oh well, that should be enough for people to pull apart for a few days.

This problem (units attacking friendly units for which they have DEFEND
status) has certainly been around for a long time.  I remember
discussions about it on turn 2.  If I were writing the game I would
ensure that a unit never attacks another unit which it would defend.
But Rich wasn't persuaded of the value of this change.

In a previous post I mentioned sequential sublocation ids as the
silliest G1 feature, but Jeremy has reminded me of the non-flying
dragons (and non-flying giant birds).

Maybe we should have a "silliest feature" contest.

I wonder why Rich isn't answering my mail anymore? :-)

I claimed that you could do the same thing through a fantasy element
like astral travel or teleportation, which would keep the theme all
fantasy, but have the same result of separated worlds. I think that
separated worlds is a good idea, but they need to be separated enough
that you can't get around the separation. For example, Hades in Oly
can still be scryed/visioned/orbed into, you can teleport huge armies
into it, and many players have enough spare gold to carry huge armies
(of, say, dragons) into it through graveyards. So it isn't a good
separated world. A good separated world in Oly might only allow single
nobles to enter it, with only as much stuff as they can personally
carry, and visions/orbs/teleport/farcast can't cross the barrier. Then
at worst you could have your experienced mage cross over, carrying a
billion gold pieces.

Well, we've discussed before the kinds of things that I would want to
do with your Oly engine in order to make it space-game-compatible, and
it wasn't so bad.

Gentlemen:

	If we're agreed that the combat rules give too much emphasis to 
weenie troops (crossbowmen & pikemen) over cool troops (elite guards & 
elite archers), they why not simply increase the values of these 
higher-end units so that they make sense to build?  One would still have 
to weigh the relative advantages of ease of building (wood is easier to 
get then iron & horses) over long range strength.

perhaps something like:

elite guard:  500/500/0

or even high numbers (friggin warhorse takes soooo long to train).

	Combine this with limitations on beasts as people have been 
discussing, & an elite guard doesn't look too shabby.

	In addition, the skills of swordsmanship & defence (& archery 
too) could confer a significant bonus for use (say, an increase in 
ability of 10 points per use at the apprentice level, up to 20 points per 
use high up).  It's amazing to me that people are using these skills 
anyway (note recent GMs report) with their negligible affect on combat.  

	Along the same lines, magic items should be more powerful (swords 
& things).  As of now they're basically status symbols & little more.  
Let one aura be translated into 50 instead of 5 points.  That would make 
that +1000 armor a little more useful.

Also, Last Rites has no range limit. This was a disturbing notion
early in the game when BtA died, and could have been Last Rited before
he could be raised, only the anti-AOO folks couldn't find any priests.
I think Rich is considering changing LR to require the body in G2, or
be done by someone friendly to the corpse.

I assume you have tongue in cheek?  Let's do the math shall we?  A
noble starts at (80,80,0).  It takes 6 days to raise 1 point (I assume
once you are grand master the skill only takes 6 days).  So (1250 -
80) * 6 / 30 = 234.  So to get from 80,80,0 to 1250,80,0 would take
234 turns.  If you are willing to wait 4.5 years of REAL TIME, you
*might* survive combat with a novice and 10 peasants.  

I just realized I made a glaring error in my computation, you listed
(1250,1250,0), so that's 9 years of real time, not 4.5.  Of course, if
you are able to find a few magic items, you might be able to shave a
few years off of your effort.

I guess this proves how useful defense and swordplay are.  

These skills might be more valuable (and magic items to boot) if they
provided a bonus to the entire stack.  Every 10 points of defense over
80 adds 1 point of defense to everybody in the stack.  Every 10 points
of archery over 80 adds 1 point to every unit with a missle attack,
etc.

Heh.  Another one I forgot.  This is particularly amusing when you

	1: it reuses the experience system (which is under used but good)

	The combination of 1&2 will also mean that attaining high levels of

Following a general view that beastmastery is too good, there've
been several suggested changes to bring it into balance with the
rest of the game. Most of the proposed changes have been more
suitable for a fresh start in G2, here's an "upgrade" path for G1.

1) Use the wild horse/riding horse idea to split each existing
beast type into wild and trained versions - different item numbers.

2) Introduce a skill (or maybe skill per type) of training wild
beasts, taking some time to train each individual creature.

3) Make new beasts captured or bred always the wild type.

4) For a transtional period, have wild and trained beasts both
function as the original single type.

5) On some future pre-announced turn stop the wild versions
having any combat value when held by players.

Suitable choices of all the numbers could give a toned down but
still valuble beastmastery skill, but have a relativly small impact
on the existing game.

I'd like to add something to all you said.Why not implement,a 1-1
relation between the noble and the units stacked with him? For each
noble in the stack there should be a single (combat) beast under
control,not allowing "1 noble 10 dragons" units ,which,despite being
fun and pitoresque are greatly unrealistic .Please note that it is
still possible to have more than one beast in a unit,by having
additional beastmastering nobles stacked within.Perhaps for lower
combat-valued beasts there could be a skill that enabled a noble to
control two or three beasts,but never unlimited ammounts of them,the
fact that they are tamed does not imply they stop being beasts,and I
find it hard to control more than a dragon at the same time :)

Some of the recent postings on Olympia and the need for various
"fixes" got me thinking about some of the macro issues in the game.

Some background-- Game theory refers to the modeling of games.  It
started as a branch of mathamatics and has been subsequently
developed in numerous academic disciplines.  Some of its most
interesting applications occur in social situations characterized by
strategic interaction, those instances in which the action of one
individual are influence by the actions (and expectations of actions)
of others.  Not the best summary but one that can work to save
bandwidth....;-)

1.  The concept of Game economics. 

IMHO, olympia greatest feature is its movement and inventory
features.  Fairly intuitive, relatively bug free, etc.  Its weakest
feature remains its failure to encourage an "economy".  By economy I
mean something generic, the exchange of goods and services between
players out of mutual self interest.  A good example of a game with
economy is diplomacy, in which gains/victory require that players
cooperate, albeit temporarily, with each other.  A game that
has very little economic interactions would be black jack in which
the players all are individually playing against the house and exert
very litle influence on each other.

2.  Why economies develop

Economies develop for a number of reasons and require a number of
underlying factors to operate.  While there is some debate over
this, most agree that economies develop because the actors benenfit
from exchange.  Furthermore, they most often benefit from exchange
because they are each able to more efficiently produce 1 particular
good and then swamp surpluses with each other.  The famous example
concerns British cloth and Spainish wine.

A key concept is that of value added which I take to mean in game
contexts that the interaction between the players adds more value
than simply a sum of the existing parts.  That is, that two players
can do more seperately than if one player controlled all the
nobles.

In addition to the potential benefits of exchange, for economies to
develop requires punishment of
those individuals who "shirk" and attempt to cheat.  Punishments can
range from the powers of the state to ostracism and detrimental
exclusion from future interactions.

3.  Why Olympia doesn't encourage economic exchange.

Simply put, olympia doesn't encourage economic cooperative because
of the limited advantages to specialization. This strikes across
many categories.  For example, post BTA's production of the
Auraculum there has been very little reason to specialize as a magic
faction.  The mage faction, without Auraculum can provide only
minimal services to other factions while they do not recieve
benefits from cooperating with an obvious target.  Another example
concerns beastmastery, either in the old or the proposed "fix" as
there are little benefit to specializing in beastmastery.  One could
go on and on.  IMHO, the basic olympia "strategy" is to simply
exist, building up in all areas at a relatively equal rate.  The
result is that economic exchange is fairly limited between
homogenous looking factions.

4.  the Present form of cooperation.

Many readers have been shaking their heads and yelling "I have
allies!!  What is he saying???!!!"  I would posit, however, that the
present alliances are largely for two purposes.  One is what could
be call the "social alliance."  It makes playing olympia a lot more
fun, you exchange resources, provide assistance in wars, etc. etc.
However, the actual strategic (as opposed to social) benefits of
that cooperation, I believe, can be questioned. 

Second are the so called "meta-alliances".  These are groupings that
exist for reasons outside of the game universe.  They are based upon
associations brought from other games (alpha, beta, non-olympia) or
have arisen as Role playing devices.  But in terms of pure economic
mechanics, their utility has to be judged by the criteria that the
whole is greater than the sum of their parts.  I think that in most
of these alliances there is little "value added" by the cooperation
occuring.

5.  Fixing olympia.

If a goal, and I think it should be, is reforming olympia to
ecourage higher levels of exchange, I propose the following......

a.  Each faction allowed four "free" skills.  Excluding necromancy,
all factions would be allowed to study the first four base skills
free of charge.  This would count across the entire faction, so that
if each noble studies combat it would count as 1 skill.

b.  The next 4 skills cost 1 noble points

c.  The next 4 skills cost 2 noble points

d.  The next 4 cost 3

etc. etc.

However, there should be (and I would have to think about this
carefully), certain exceptions to skills that can be learned by
scroll.  These would not require knowledge of the base skill.  These
should be "end use" skills for products produced by others.  The
obvious one that comes to mind is use beasts in battle.  Thus you
could have a non-beastmaster faction benefit fromt he products that
the beast mastery faction produces.  Other possible candidates are
"build structure" (with the stones others produce) or "catrips"
(basically a minor form of perform common tasks).

Though radical, the advantage of this proposal is that it would
insure faction specialization.  Factions could, of course, last it
out and eventually learn everything.  But meanwhile lots of value
added as the various specialized factions trade goods/services with
each other.  Furthermore, by insuring that a decent collection of
skills can be learned early on, it insures that players will not
feel trapped by the choices that they made.

A long while back I proposed an Olympia variant where any single
faction would be restricted to X skill/spell categories.  I'd say
that X should be somewhere between one (a Mining faction would be
pretty dull, eh?) and seven (minimum required for supermagi...)

In alpha I tried to play a religion-based faction and it worked
pretty well but I did dabble in the other categories.  I think
that Rich coincidentally finished the prayer coding at virtually
the same instant I joined the game which made me actually useful
to lots of factions that had written it off as useless.

The specialization in Atlantis II makes it somewhat frustrating.
My job there is sort of like the IRS, basically taxing and giving
the cash to magic research labs and industrial consortia to play
with, as well as some modest defense spending of course.  If one
had to specialize in Olympia IV folks would pine for the good old
days too, I think.  I miss my Atlantis I wizards. :>(

My two cents on the broke stuff is that 99% of it can be fixed by :

A. Adjusting combat ratings (e.g. elite guards), weights (e.g. dragons) etc.
B. Revamping the beast breeding charts to slow down production of good
   beasts (e.g. only chimera + nazgul produce dragons with 25% chance
   for either parent to die and 50% chance of stillborn baby dragon.)
   In other words, dragon breeding becomes almost a zero-sum equation.
   Beasts that fly and/or with high combat ratings should be difficult
   or impossible to breed.  (Sure, why not impossible to breed, for
   instance, giant birds?)
C. Rethinking Faerie, Cloudlands and Hades to discourage the "warp zone"
   concept.  These should be places that anybody *can* get to but that
   nobody can reasonably aspire to "control"  Restrict access absolutely
   to nobles and non-combat items.  (No recruiting, teleporting, breeding,
   capturing, etc.)  Access from Olympia should be dynamic (i.e. locations
   of faerie hills, mountain under Cloudlands, GYs with Hades access
   changes every other game year or something...)
D. Scaling inner location rewards and making inner loc IDs non-sequential.
   Prisoners/control artifacts/magic books should be *extremely* rare and
   require exploration, multiple required artifacts, etc.  Those lone
   centaur guards should have trade goods, artifact weapons or a little
   gold.  Unfortunately, large alliances are able to handle inner locs
   with item requirements better than lone factions but the required
   items are always found within a single region so lone factions can
   toward the netherlands and aspire to success here.

Okay, so it was more than two cents...

No, the point was that an unrestricted "warp zone" is a bad thing to
have in Olympia.  I think that there is an overwhelming group percep-
tion that the time required to move from point A to point B should
be fairly long.  Witness the general concensus that roads would, if
anything, make Olympia worse.  I would like to see flying in G2 a
somewhat rare mode of transport.  I know of factions in G1 that
refuse to walk anywhere, ever.  Gate travel is costly enough that
it's virtually never used.  The three worst offenders to appropriate
travel times are Faerie, flying and Hades.  Okay, okay, I admit that
I'd like to see more public access to cloudlands in g2, but who
really gives a flying stack about cloudlands.

	year or two to actually garrison it.  I don't happen to think that was

	It would have been even harder if the entrance from the clouds to
	the mundane world had changed every year, but I would still have stuck
	at it.

	Restricting Teleporting into hades and faerie might be an option though.
	If they are somehow separate from the rest of Olympia then it would
	make a certain amount of sense to have teleport not work between the
	real world and those other places.  Or maybe a different spell must be
	researched and studied.

	Recruiting _is_ limited in the clouds (I don't know about hades /
	Faerie).  On a slightly sillier note, so is the summoning of weather,
	Rich, that really should be changed in G2.

	Oh and a final note.  The Cloudlands can't be used as a warp zone.

Then how come you can still attack people who have moved out ?  Seems  
to me that the restrictions on attack/auto-attack/auto-defend all  
ought to be the same.

Now, why don't you go and build a castle in faerie so we can test that ?  
Decessim has dragons, will travel.  :) 

Seriously, one of the many flaws in the current combat system is that
walls are virtually irrelevant to dragons.  Whether BtA teleports them
into the castle or to a noble outside really doesn't matter as far as
combat outcome is concerned.  I only teleport them in for dramatic 
effect.  If you teleport men though, walls can matter.

Actually I agree.  Faerie, Hades and Teleport Item have obsoleted
geography for the AOO.  The former two should be drastically changed.  My
favorite way to fix the latter would be to give reasonable weights to high
combat value creatures i.e. 2500 or so for dragons.  That way teleporting
men becomes an option again and it becomes at least in principle possible
for a medium sized power to defend itself against teleports.

The problem I see with this proposal (make skills take many months to
learn) is that new players won't be able to do anything of note for a
long time.  When would the first ship have sailed from the IC if it
took a game year just to learn shipcraft, and another to learn
shipbuilding?  Closer to reality?  Yes.  More playable?  No.  

Another option would be to make all base skills (Forestry, Sailing,
etc.) require a noble point to learn.  Make magical skill classes cost
2.  This would allow players to quickly learn new skills, but not have
everyone in their faction know them (e.g. almost 2/3 of my nobles know
Beastmastery and its subskills).

Maybe even combine the two.  Give players the option of spending an NP
to drastically cut down the study time.

>> I like that idea...

It's so stinking obvious, I can't believe someone didn't think of it
before.

What I like even more is the hybrid:  make skills take obscenely long
to learn, e.g. 1 game year for a "regular" skill, and one month for
subskills.  Magical skills take 2 game years to learn, at minimum
(e.g. Necro may take 4).

A noble can buy a factor of 32 reduction by spending an NP.  That
means I can study a base skill in a week by spending an NP, or a
subskill in a day if I spend an NP.

That still allows generalist development, but at glacial speed.  For
example, if I know I'm going to be hanging out on a continent for a
while, I can develop a forester and a shipbuilder slowly, while
quickly developing other skills.

I've been playing Olympia since turn 43. I realize that that makes me
  a relative newcomer, but I think it's long enough for me to
  have gotten a feel for things. I see very little inter-player trade
  going on. Almost everyone has become a generalist. If you want a
  ship, you build it yourself. If you want swords, you make them.
  There is nothing like an economy based on making and trading goods.

I've been thinking about the general design of games of this ilk, such
  as Oly and Atlantis. A central problem is that of interdependancy of
  factions. Simply put, the game works best if factions need to work
  together, rather than one being able to work completely on it's own
  and grow exponentially to a point where it completely overpowers
  it's neighbors and dominates the game. Interplayer cooperation is
  better fostered if players have incentive to specialize, rather than
  having every faction able to do everything.

Atlantis tried to solve this problem by creating types of factions,
  military, trade, and magic, similar to D&D's character classes.
  Military and trade factions could not have mages, military and magic
  factions could not produce goods, and trade and magic factions could
  not have significant armies. This is, of course, a simplification of
  the way it works, but you get the idea. Thus, if a military faction
  wants swords, they need to work with a trade faction, and if they
  want magical support, they need to work with a magic faction, an so
  on. While this seems to work, it is very artificial. I quit playing
  D&D because I hated the restrictive class system (Why is it
  completely impossible for my 18 intelligence mage to learn to pick a
  simple lock?).

Olympia tries to avoid the problem by the use of noble points, but
  doesn't quite manage to cause much in the way of specialization.

For instance, if I need a ship, I have two basic choices: make
  it myself, or trade with someone else for one. Trading with someone
  else involves finding someone who has or will make one, and then
  waiting for them to bring it to me, or else going forth to pick it
  up. This takes time, probably several turns, in addition the the
  construction time. 

On the other hand, it only takes one noble-week for me to have a fully
  qualified shipbuilder trained up and ready to go. Another noble-week 
  and I've got a noble ready to harvest the wood I need. Why should I ever 
  buy a ship from someone else, when I can be ready to make my own in two
  noble-weeks? 

This leads to there being no niche for shipbuilders in the game.
  A game like Olympia should be full of niches, like shipbuilders,
  weaponmakers, transportation companies, miners, et al. But since
  anyone can set themself up to do just about anything in a few turns,
  the niches simply aren't there.

Then there's also the consideration of realism, if we want to consider
  it. Does anyone *really* think they can learn to build a sailing
  ship in just a week? It should take months, at a minimum. Similarly
  for most other skills. One doesn't learn to make a sword in a week.

I think Olympia would be a better game if skills took longer to learn.
  It would encourage people to specialize and fill niches, rather than
  all of us being generalists who can do anything, and thus don't need
  to work together.

If it took months to learn to make a ship, and years (game years) to
  become really good at it, then those who took the time to learn
  would have a market for their products. Other players would seriously
  consider buying a ship from someone else, rather than just spending
  a week training one of their own people to do it.

A faction would still be able to do anything they wanted, but it would
  take a long time. There would be no artificial constraints on what
  you can do. You could make a decent profit without a castle, by
  spending your time learning to do something that those who built
  castles haven't had the time to learn.
  
I also think that the experience system should be used more heavily.
  Right now all it seems to do is shorten the time required to do
  something. There should be a difference in quality as well. Maybe
  apprentice shipbuilders should only be able to make galleys, and
  only journeymen or adepts should be able to make roundships.
  Other skills could have other progressions.
  
It is also too easy to become very experienced. Becoming
  a grand master at something should require years of working at it,
  not just 9 tries. A swordmaker should have to make dozens of swords
  before he is even a journeyman.

I've been playing Olympia for only 33 turns, yet I already know 52 of 
  the 70 skills. I've got nobles that are masters or grand masters in
  several skills. By turn 100 I may know every skill in the game
  (magic spells not included). In 12 game years should half a dozen
  nobles be able to learn everything there is to know? I don't think
  so.

Yes, this would make the game start slower, but once a few player had
  gotten over the first hurdles, trade between factions would start
  up, and a real economy could develop.

One could even borrow a page from Odyssey and allow people to pick a
  few skills to start out with. You could have a point system like
  Odyssey has for it's setup, and allow starting players to spend
  points on extra nobles, and on training them in some basic skills.
  Points could also be used to start out with goods, similar to the
  gold and wood that people currently start out able to claim. This
  would make the startup go a bit more quickly, while still keeping
  people from being able to learn to do everything too quickly.

Well, this has already gotten far too long, but what do others think?
  Would slowing down learning make the game go too slowly, or would it
  enrich it my fostering more trade and cooperation?

Yeah, once anything gets into the "failed" queue, it takes forever for
it to be reprocessed. My turn which ran was mailed from pbm.com, and I
didn't typo on the address this time.

BTW, my guy who had his HONOR fail because he was 3 gold short
renounced loyalty. I believe I reported that HONOR behavior as a bug a
year ago... bad Rich, no donut.

Since I don't pay, I might as well restart ;-)

I forget, what do I need to send you? A name for the oath-2 noble and the
faction? I wonder if it's possible to get out of the IC alive these days?
I hope G2 has multiple starting points from the start ;-) And if you're
worried about players whining about them moving in the future, you might
want to put a message on other cities that they will eventually become
starting cities.
