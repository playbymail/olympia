Fight to the death [612]
------------------------
Usage:   USE 612 <0|1>
Time:    0 days

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  Knowledge of 612 allows a leader to override
this default break point and set it to 100% instead.

    Break at 50% losses:   USE 612 1  (default)
    Fight to the death:    USE 612 0

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for 612 is checked.
612 works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.


Construct battering ram [701]
-----------------------------
Usage:  USE 701

Requires:  three wood [77]
           one iron [79]
           three workers [11]

Produces:  one battering ram [60]

Time:      fourteen days

The craftsman constructs a battering ram by selecting a large,
heavy tree trunk, sharpening the end somewhat and plating it
with iron, and then suspending it in a movable wooden frame
such that it may be swung back and forth against walls or gates.

The frame receives an iron plated roof to protect the operators
from boiling oil or pitch, rocks, or other missile weapons hurled
down upon them by the enemy.
