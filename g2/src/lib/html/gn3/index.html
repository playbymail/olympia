Shipcraft [600]
---------------
All skills concerning ocean travel fall under this category.
Shipcraft encompasses the building and repair of ships,
training of sailors, and navigation at sea.

The following skills may be studied directly once Shipcraft is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   601    Sailing                            two weeks
   602    Shipbuilding                       two weeks
   603    Fishing                            two weeks



Shipbuilding [602]
------------------
Usage:     BUILD galley "Name of ship"
or         BUILD roundship "Name of ship"

Requires:  at least three workers [11]
	   50 wood [77] for a galley, 100 wood for a roundship

Time:      250 worker-days for a galley, 500 for a roundship

To begin construction of a ship, the shipbuilder should unstack from
beneath other characters and issue one of the BUILD orders.  One-fifth
of the lumber is required to start construction.  The rest is deducted
as progress on the ship is made (the second fifth at 20% completion,
the third fifth at 40% completion, etc.)

The shipbuilder and his workers will be placed inside the new ship.

As soon as the required number of worker-days has been invested in
construction, the ship will be christened and declared seaworthy.

To resume construction of a partially completed ship, first enter the
ship, then issue the either "build galley" or "build roundship".

Ships may only be built in locations with a passable route to an
ocean, such as a port city.


Combat [610]
------------
The student of combat learns the training of soldiers and how
to lead them well in battle.  With study and experience, the
battle lord will find strategies to be used in difficult combat
situations.
