Appear common [803]
-------------------
Usage:  USE 803 <aura>

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The caster expends aura to conceal the fact that he is a magician.
Nobles who possess magical powers are identified to others in the turn
reports with a tag:

         max aura        tag
         --------        ---
           6-10          conjurer
          11-15          mage
          16-20          wizard
          21-30          sorcerer
           30+             ??

Use of 803 allows the tag to be suppressed for a number of turns
equal to the amount of aura invested in the cast.

Uses of 803 are addititive.  A mage with 4 turns of concealment
remaining who ordered "use 803 3" would have a total of seven turns
of concealment.
