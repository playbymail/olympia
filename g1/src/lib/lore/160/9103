Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.
This skill allows the magician to perform trivial or common tasks for
the local population of a city or province to earn gold.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love
potions, dowsing for water, or performing conjuring tricks.

The skill yields 100 gold, and may only be used by a magician once per
month.  Also, only the first magician to perform @@@@ in a city or
province each month receives any gold.
