Harvest lumber [702]
--------------------
Usage:     WOOD [number] [days]
Time:      as given or necessary
Requires:  at least one worker [11]

Workers enter the forest and select trees which are suitable for felling
and sawing.  Lumber is used in the construction of ships, buildings and
some weapons.  Timber is also used to support the roofs of mine shafts.

Must be used in a forest province.  Forests generate 30 wood [77] each
month.

Examples:

    wood         # obtain as much wood as possible
    wood 25      # stop after getting 25 wood
    wood 0 5     # cut timber for five days
    wood 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 wood, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, timber cutting will cease as soon as the forest's supply
of wood for the month has been exhausted.

WOOD is an alias for COLLECT 77.

Find tradegood for sale [732]
-----------------------------
Usage:  USE 732
Time:   21 days

Use of 732 searches for a seller of a new rare
tradegood in the city market.  At the completion of use,
a new tradegood will be created and offered for sale by
the city.

Up to two tradegoods may be sold by each market.
Use of 732 will fail if there are already two rare
tradegoods for sale in the city.

The tradegood will remain for sale in the city for
24-36 months following its addition to the trade list.
At the end of this period it will be removed and no
longer offered for sale (lowering the count of tradegoods
sold in the city by 1).

732 must be used in a city in part of the regular world
(not Hades, Faery, the Cloudlands, or Subworld.)

Markets for rare tradegoods created with 732 may be
found via the skill Find market for tradegood [733].
