Swordplay [616]
---------------
Usage:  USE 616
Time:   seven days

Use of 616 will cause the noble to spend time and effort practicing
swordplay, for use in personal combat.  Each seven-day use of 616
raises the noble's attack rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the time
the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and will
gain 10 points.

Knowledge of Swordplay also allows the noble to train swordsmen,
knights, and elite guards, via the TRAIN order.




Petty thievery [631]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 631
Time:   seven days

The skill of the common burglar, 631 allows a thief to work a
city for gold.  The thief may pick pockets, steal from merchants
in the market, enter homes in search of loot, or deceive townsfolk
into parting with their gold with confidence games.

631 may only be used in a city, where there are many opportunities
for the petty thief.  Since reports of thievery tend to make the
city residents tense and alert, 631 may only be used once per month
in each city.

A thief will earn between 50 and 150 gold for each successful use of
631.  There is a 5% chance that instead of obtaining gold, the thief
will be caught and beaten, and receive a 5-15 point health loss.

The amount of gold the thief obtains from the city is deducted from
the city's tax base for the month.

Cities which have recently been pillaged offer no opportunities for
petty thievery, as the residents have already been stripped of their
valuables, and are wary of strangers.
