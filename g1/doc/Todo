I have a question about the report in Olympia. What does the number in
front of the units listed in a location?

The numbers I am wonder about are 8 for the three first units and 9
for the last one in the following example.

Forest [ct27], forest, in Lesser Atnos, civ-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 8: Benhaha [5219], with 14 peasants, ten workers, left for Forest [ct26].
 8: Gorge [3742], with six peasants, left for City [ew50].
 8: Taraza [2742] arrived.
 9: Taraza [2742] left for Forest [ct26].


If it is the stacking order does this then mean that there are 7 more
stacks that I can't see?
