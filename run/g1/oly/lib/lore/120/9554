A galley fitted with a ram is a most effective ocean fighting
vessel.  The oars permit the ship to be maneuvered in battle,
regardless of wind conditions.  The ram allows a galley to crush
the sides of enemy ships.

To use this skill, the character must enter the galley and issue
USE @@@@.  The galley will be fitted with an iron-tipped ram.
The character need not be in control of the ship in order to
perform the modification.

Rams may not be added to roundships or unfinished galleys.
