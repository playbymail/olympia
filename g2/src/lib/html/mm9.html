Defense [614]
-------------
Usage:  USE 614

Time:   seven days

The noble will spend time and effort practicing skills and
techniques of personal and combat defense.  Each use of 614
raises the noble's defense rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the
time the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and
will gain 10 points.


Scry location [841]
-------------------
Usage:  USE 841 <location> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Grants the mage a vision of the specified place, no matter
how far away he might be.

If the target location is magically shrouded from scry attempts,
sufficient aura must be used for 841 to pierce the shroud.
For example, a location shroud of three aura would require
USE 841 <location> 4 to overcome (costing four aura to cast).

It is not possible to scry a netherworld location (a location in
Hades or Faery) from the real world, or vice-versa.

The default aura to use is one point.
