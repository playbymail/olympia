Stone quarrying [682]
---------------------
Usage:     QUARRY [number of stones] [days]
Requires:  at least one worker

Building stone is used in the construction of temples, castles and
towers.  Up to 50 stone may be removed from mountain provinces or
rocky hills each month, or up to ten stone from desert provinces.

Each worker will cut and prepare one building stone [78] per day.

Examples:

    quarry         # cut as much building stone as possible
    quarry 25      # stop after cutting 25 stone
    quarry 0 5     # quarry stone for five days
    quarry 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 stone, whichever
                   # comes first

In all cases, quarrying will cease as soon as the supply of ready stone
in the province has been exhausted.


Harvest lumber [702]
--------------------
Usage:     WOOD [number] [days]
Time:      as given or necessary
Requires:  at least one worker [11]

Workers enter the forest and select trees which are suitable for felling
and sawing.  Lumber is used in the construction of ships, buildings and
some weapons.  Timber is also used to support the roofs of mine shafts.

Must be used in a forest province.  Forests generate 30 wood [77] each
month.

Examples:

    wood         # obtain as much wood as possible
    wood 25      # stop after getting 25 wood
    wood 0 5     # cut timber for five days
    wood 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 wood, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, timber cutting will cease as soon as the forest's supply
of wood for the month has been exhausted.

WOOD is an alias for COLLECT 77.
