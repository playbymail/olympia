Magic
-----

Magic is the dark art by which events are influenced outside of the
normal boundaries of cause-and-effect.  Rather than the glamorous
ideal of shining wizards casting powerful fireballs at wicked foes,
the reality of magic instead tends to be base, tedious work which
earns few friends.

Hated and feared, the magician pursues his craft out of the sight of
men.  Like wisps of smoke rising from an ember cast into dry straw,
so the mage's spells slowly take hold, woven with secret knowledge
and foul ingredients.

The casting of a magical spell is accomplished with three ingredients:
Knowledge of the spell, possession of any items necessary to fuel the
spell, and a sufficient level of magical aura to perform the ritual or
ceremony.


Aura
----

Aura is a mystical force necessary to cast spells.  Powerful mages will
have a high aura rating, while apprentice sorcerers may only command a
few points worth of aura.

Characters are rated for their current aura level and their maximum aura
level.  Maximum aura will automatically increase as the magician studies
spells and practices their use.  Current aura is depleted by casting
spells.  It is naturally replenished at a rate not less than one point
per turn.  Other ways of gaining current aura may be found as the mage
researches his craft.

Spells are rated on the amount of aura which the casting mage must
possess.  Minor spells may demand only one point of aura to cast.
Powerful spells may require a current aura level of ten or higher.


Required Items
--------------

Many spells will require the magician to possess a rare or obscure item
in order for the cast to succeed.  Many of these items exist, of interest
chiefly to sorcerers.  Roots from plants found only in dense forests,
bat's wings, and a dark blue powder which produces a brilliant cobalt
flame when burned are only a few.  Usually the required item is consumed
by the attempt to cast the spell.


Study of Spells
---------------

Magic is divided into six main schools of study:

	160  Magic
	161  Weather magic
	162  Scrying
	163  Gatecraft
	164  Artifact construction
	165  Necromancy

An aspiring mage will issue the STUDY order to learn the basics of a
particular school of magic, known as the category skill.  For example,
one wishing to pursue knowledge of Magic [160] would order:

	STUDY 160

Once the category skill has been learned, the mage will receive a lore
sheet listing some of the known spells of that school.  The magician may
then attempt to learn these spells through study.

A character must know the category skill for a school of magic before a
spell in that school can be known.

Only some of the spells in the each school are commonly known.  The more
rare, obscure or powerful spells will need to be discovered via RESEARCH
or by finding magic scrolls describing them.

Knowledge of individual spells in a school of magic is not possible
without having learned the category skill.


Schools of Magic
----------------

Magic [106]

    The most common and well-known of the magical schools, Magic
    nonetheless has many useful and powerful spells.

    Since many cities offer instruction in Magic, and several useful
    spells may be learned quickly, apprentice mages often begin their
    studies here.

Weather magic [161]

    The study of spells to control the elements.  Advanced weather
    magicians are said to research forgotten elf-lore in the hopes of
    finding tools to battle evil.

Scrying [162]

    Scrying is the study of magical far-seeing, the ability to view
    images or learn information at a distance.

Gatecraft [163]

    The study of ancient portals of teleportation which long ago connected
    distant regions of the land.  Knowledge of this lost art tends to be
    difficult to acquire and jealously guarded when found.

Artifact construction [164]
 
    The realm of very advanced sorcerers, artifact construction concerns
    the making of physical items to focus, amplify or otherwise enhance
    a mage's power.  Most spells in this school require the magician to
    possess high levels of aura.

Necromancy [165]

    The darkest of the Dark Arts, necromancy involves trafficking with
    undead or demon spirits to gain knowledge.  Hated by civilized men,
    feared by other magicians, the necromancer seeks power and domination
    over the physical world.

-----------------------------

Magic [160]

No apprentice magician can rightfully don the robes of his order without
some knowledge of Magic [160].  Magic contains many spells useful on
their own, as well as in conjunction with spells from the other schools 
of sorcery.

Knowledge of Magic [160] permits the study of the following spells:

	spell						required study
	-----						--------------
	Meditate [9101]					   2 weeks
	View current aura level of others [9105]	   3 weeks
	Quicken casting of next spell [9106]		   3 weeks
	Heal [9146]					   4 weeks
	Modern script of magic lore [9147]		   4 weeks

Further spells must be discovered through research or other means.

	Cloak magical aura [9112]			   2 weeks
	Reveal abilities of another mage [9123]		   4 weeks
	Haste [9158]					   4 weeks
	Slow [9159]					   4 weeks
	Shroud abilities from scry [9169]
	Detect ability scry [9170]

-----------------------------

Weather magic [161]

The school of weather magic is based on ancient elven spells
used to bend control of the elements to the will of the mage.

Not strictly limited to weather control, these spells are tools
the powerful Elf-wizards used long ago to make their world more
pleasant and to battle the forces of evil.

Simple weather spells may summon or predict various kinds of
weather.  More advanced spells deal with the reading and
transcription of elf-scrolls, and elimination of the products
of foul magic from regions.

Knowledge of Weather magic [161] permits the study of the
following spells:

	Summon fog [9132]
	Summon rain [9135]
	Summon wind [9136]
	Fog of death [9134]
	Predict future weather [9133]
	Script of the Elf-wizards [9148]

Further spells must be discovered through research or other means.

	Finger of god [9137]
	Project next weather spell [9138]
	Reveal source of last month's weather [9139]
	Conceal source of weather influence [9140]
	Script of the Elf-wizards [9148]
	Banish undead from region [9157]

-----------------------------

Scrying [162]

Scrying concerns the gathering of information by means of magical
spells.  Simple spells may allow the mage to learn information
about other characters nearby, or to view distant regions.

Advanced study delves into spells wrought long ago in by the men of
Areth-Pirn as tools to rule their land, including the erection of
magical barriers to travel as well as additional spells of far-seeing.

Knowledge of Scrying [162] permits the study of the
following spells:

	Scry region [9141]
	Ciphered writing of Areth-Pirn [9151]
	Conceal identity [9163]
	Locate nearest city that teaches skill [9168]

Further spells must be discovered through research or other means.

	Shroud region from magical scry [9142]
	Dispel location shroud [9143]
	Dispel cloaking from artifact [9144]
	Create magical barrier [9160]
	Remove magical barrier [9161]
	Locate artifact [9166]
	Locate character [9167]

-----------------------------

Gatecraft [163]

Long ago the Ancients, a race of wise men who ruled the land with
the aid of powerful magic, constructed a network of teleportation
gateways to connect distant cities.  As the reach of their magical
portals grew, so grew the reach of their armies and knowledge.  At
their height the rule of the Ancients extended to every corner of
the known world, and beyond.

With the passing of the Ancients, the system of gates fell into
disuse and decay, and now retains only a hint of its former majesty.
Gatecraft, once practiced by the most common among the Ancients, has
since been forgotten by nearly all men.

The school of Gatecraft retains the only knowledge of the use of
these mystical portals.  Because knowledge of Gates can be a powerful
tool or weapon, Gatecraft spells are jealously guarded even within
the school.  Some aspects of Gatecraft, such as the secret of their
construction, have been completely lost.

Knowledge of Gatecraft [163] permits the study of the
following spells:

	Detect gates [9115]
	Jump through gate [9116]

Further spells must be discovered through research or other means.

	Seal gate [9117]
	Unseal gate with key [9118]
	Notify if gate unsealed [9119]
	Forcefully unseal gate [9120]
	Reveal gate key [9121]
	Notify of gate jumps [9122]
	Forge gate [9125]
	Destroy gate [9126]
	Language of the Ancients [9152]
	Reverse jump through gate [9165]

-----------------------------

Artifact construction [164]

The domain of high level wizards, artifact construction concerns
the creation and manipulation of items which may focus and store
aura, contain spells, or have other magical properties.

Knowledge of Artifact construction [164] permits the study of the
following spells:

	Reveal creator of magical artifact [9108]
	Reveal spells in artifact [9150]
	Destroy magical artifact [9164]

Further spells must be discovered through research or other means.

	Forge magical artifact [9102]
	Expand power of magical artifact [9103]
	Reveal region of artifact creation [9109]
	Cloak creator of artifact [9110]
	Cloak region of artifact creation [9111]
	Trap spell in magical artifact [9149]
	Arcane symbols of the Nether demons [9153]
	Cloak spells in artifact [9162]

-----------------------------

Necromancy [165]

The way of the necromancer leads to fresh graves, the pits of Hades,
and unspeakable horrors found only in dark corners of men's souls.

Power is gained through animation and enslavement of the dead, both
followers as well as nobles.  A necromancer looks upon a bloody
battlefield strewn with the dead as a potential army waiting to be
trained.

Advanced necromancers wield fierce powers, manipulating evil Runes
to effect their will upon the world, and making pacts with demons
to obtain power in return for souls.

With great power also comes great danger, and necromancy is the most
dangerous of the magical arts.  Only those willing to risk death at
the hands of civilized men, or worse fates meted out by demons sent
from the underworld, should even consider its study.

Knowledge of Necromancy [165] permits the study of the
following spells:

	Sacrifice noble [9104]
	Animate corpses into undead [9114]
	Exhume dead bodies [9130]
	Exhume dead noble [9131]
	Execute noble [????]

Further spells must be discovered through research or other means.

	Transform undead into skeleton warriors [9127]
	Contract of power [9128]
	Eating of the dead [9129]
	Animate dead noble into undead follower [9145]
	Runes of Evil [9154]
	Construct cursed death-scroll [9155]
	Teleport Self [9156]

-----------------------------

Spell:  Meditate [9101]

Usage:  USE 9101

Required aura:  none
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

The magician enters a restful trance which regenerates body, mind
and current aura level.  Current aura level will rise by one point.
Meditation may allow current aura to rise above maximum aura by one
point.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Forge auraculum [9102]

Usage:  USE 9102 <aura-level> "Name"

Required aura:   as specified by caster
Required items:  100 gold, 5 mithril
Time to cast:    fourteen days

Forge a magical auraculum, giving it the specified name.

   An auraculum is a magical artifact which concentrates and amplifies
   a mage's power.  A permanent investment of maximum aura is made when
   constructing the auraculum.  The artifact doubles the invested aura.
   However, since a portion of the mage's pneuma has been bound in the
   auraculum, it is important to safeguard it from being lost or stolen.

In addition to depleting the caster's current aura level, the specified
aura amount will be permanently removed from the magician's maximum aura
rating.  The new object, while possessed by its maker, will augment the
mage's maximum aura rating by twice the amount of aura invested in its
creation.

Creation of an auraculum also grants knowledge of the Advanced sorcery
magical skill category.  Advanced sorcery may not be learned in any
other way.

Example:

   A mage of current aura level 10, maximum aura 10 who issues
   USE @@@@ 5 "Ring of power" will be reduced to current aura level 5,
   maximum aura level 5.  However, the new artifact will add 10 points
   to the maximum aura rating of its creator, but only while it is in
   his possession.

    1: > use @@@@ 5 "Ring of power"
    1: Attempt to forge an auraculum.
       ...
   14: Created Ring of power [js80].
   14: Learned Advanced sorcery [166].

       Current aura:   5
       Maximum aura:   15 (5+10)
 
Characters other than the auraculum's creator do not receive an aura
bonus from possession of the object.

Since the mage has bound a portion of his aura into the artifact, its
destruction would deal him an instant, fatal blow.  Thus, the creator
of such an object should use all means to prevent it from being lost
or stolen.  However, magical items of such power are hard to destroy.
An auraculum may only be destroyed in the province in which it was
created.

This spell may only be used once.  A magician may only create one
auraculum during his lifetime.

The creator of the artifact may change its name later with the
NAME order.  The object must be possessed in order to rename it.

   > name js80 "Wooden staff"
   Ring of power [js80] will now be known as Wooden staff [js80].

-----------------------------





It is unlikely that the item could be harmed
outside of the region in which it was created.

Since the mage has bound a portion of his aura into the artifact,
its destruction would cause him to instantly perish.  Thus, the
creator of such an object should take all means to prevent it from
being lost or stolen.  However, magical items of such power are
hard to destroy.  It is unlikely that the item could be harmed
outside of the region in which it was created.


   In other words, the cast removes 5 points of the mage's maximum
   aura rating.  The artifact expands it by 10, to 15.  However, if 
   the artifact is lost or stolen, the mage will be reduced again to
   a maximum aura level of 5.



   For example, successful cast of USE @@@@ 5 "Ring of power" will
   create an artifact which adds 10 points to the effective maximum
   aura rating of its creator, while it is in his possession.


Creates a magical artifact, giving it the specified name.

In addition to depleting the caster's current aura level,
the specified aura amount will be permanently removed from
the magician's maximum aura rating.

	For example, a mage of current aura level 10, maximum aura
	level 10 who issues USE 9102 5 "Ring of power" will be
	reduced to current aura level 5, maximum aura level 5.

The new magical artifact will be unique, and uniquely useful to its
creator.  While possessed, the artifact will augment its creator's
maximum aura rating by an amount twice as much as the amount invested
in its creation.

	Continuing the above example, a successful cast of
	USE 9102 5 "Ring of power" will create an artifact which
	will add 10 points to the effective maximum aura rating
	of its creator, while possessed.

	Note that cast permanently diminishes the mage's maximum
	aura level by 5.  The artifact expands it by 10, to 15.
	However, if the artifact is lost or stolen, the mage
	will be reduced again to a maximum aura rating of 5.

Other characters will not receive as much benefit from the item,
perhaps gaining an aura boost of only one point, regardless of
the object's power in the hands of its creator.

Since the mage has bound a portion of his aura into the artifact,
its destruction would cause him to instantly perish.  Thus, the
creator of such an object should take all means to prevent it from
being lost or stolen.  However, magical items of such power are
hard to destroy.  It is unlikely that the item could be harmed
outside of the region in which it was created.

This spell may only be used once.  A magician may only create one
auraculum during his lifetime.

The creator of the artifact may change its name later with the
NAME order.  The object must be possessed in order to rename it.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Expand auraculum power [9103]

Usage:  USE 9103 <artifact> <item>

Required aura:  10
Required item:  another magician's auraculum
Time to cast:   fourteen days

Used by a mage who has constructed an artifact with [9102], this
spell will increase the artifact's power.  The artifact from another
mage must be obtained and specified in the usage of the spell.

The other mage's artifact will be destroyed, and its trapped aural
power will be added to the caster's artifact.  The creator of the
destroyed artifact will be killed by this spell.

	For example, a mage who has constructed an artifact [781]
	for himself obtains another magician's artifact [929].
	The spell USE 9103 781 929 would destroy object [929] (and
	kill its creator), and add [929]'s power to [781].

Any spells trapped in the destroyed artifact will be lost.  They
will not be transferred to the mage's artifact.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Sacrifice noble [9104]

Usage:  USE 9104 <character>

Required aura:  none
Required item:  Specify a prisoner to be killed
Time to cast:   seven days

The necromancer will conduct a ritual in which the designated
prisoner is sacrificed.  The ritual will trap the unfortunate
victim's life force, which will serve to infuse the caster with
aura.  The mage's current aura level will increase by 10 points
upon the noble's death.

The body of the noble is consumed by fire during the ritual.

-----------------------------

Spell:  View current aura level of others [9105]

Usage:  USE 9105

Required aura:  2
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

The current aura level of other mages present in the same location
as the caster will be shown.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Speed casting of next spell [9106]

Usage: USE 9106 <amount>

Required aura:  amount as specified above
Required item:
Time to cast:   four days

The mage trades aura for time.  The time necessary to cast
the next spell will be reduced by the amount of aura invested
in the cast of [9106].

For example, a mage who issued USE 9106 5 would lose five current
aura points.  Whatever spell the mage casts next will take five days
less than it normally would.

-----------------------------

Spell: Reveal creator of magical artifact [9108]

Usage: USE 9108 <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points of aura
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Reveal who forged a magical artifact.  The artifact in
question must be possessed by the caster.

The artifact may be shrouded against magical inspection.
If so, a greater amount of aura must be specified with
@@@@ than was used to apply the shroud.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Reveal where artifact was created [9109]

Usage:  USE 9109 <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Reveal the location in which a magical magical artifact was forged.
The artifact in question must be possessed by the caster.

Some magical artifacts may only be destroyed in the location where
they were constructed.

The artifact may be shrouded against magical inspection.  If so,
a greater amount of aura must be specified with @@@@ than was
used to apply the shroud.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Cloak creator of artifact [9110]

Usage:  USE @@@@ <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Inhibit the ability of another mage to learn the identity of the
creator of the specified magical artifact.  The artifact must be
in the inventory of the caster.

The more aura used, the more difficult it will be for another
mage to overcome the magical cloaking.

The default aura to use is one point.
Multiple casts of @@@@ on the same artifact are additive.

-----------------------------

Spell: Cloak region of artifact creation [9111]

Usage: USE @@@@ <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Inhibit the ability of another mage to learn the region in which
the specified magical artifact was created.  The artifact must
be in the inventory of the caster.

The more aura used, the more difficult it will be for another
mage to overcome the magical cloaking.

The default aura to use is one point.
Multiple casts of @@@@ on the same artifact are additive.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Cloak magical aura [9112]

Usage:  USE 9112

Required aura:  three points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days
Duration:       thirty-seven days

Prevents other mages from sensing the caster's current
aura level for the duration of the spell.

	or should it just work always

	or should it be of the form: creates concealment until
	dispelled by other magician?  ++

-----------------------------

Spell:  Curse noncreator loyalty [9113]

Usage:  USE @@@@ <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   fourteen days

Curses a forged magical artifact such that possession by any
character other than the creator will cause that character's
loyalty to erode.  The amount of loyalty lost is proportional
to the aura invested with @@@@.

For example, USE @@@@ 8192 10 would place a ten aura noncreator
curse on artifact [8192].  Anyone except the artifact's creator
would lose ten points of loyalty each turn that they held the
object.

Multiple uses of @@@@ on the same artifact are additive.

Aura defaults to one.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Animate corpses [9114]

Usage:  USE 9114 <number>

Required aura:  number as specified above
Required item:  dead bodies in inventory
Time to cast:   seven days

Converts the number of dead bodies specified into undead
followers.  One point of aura is consumed for each dead body
which to be converted.

Undead followers are not useful as workers.  As soldiers, they
have rather poor physical fighting ability, but often successfully
intimidate foes with their foul stench and horrific appearance.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Detect gates [9115]

Usage:  USE 9115

Required aura:  one point
Required item:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Identify any gates present in the current location.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Jump through gate [9116]

Usage:  USE 9116 <gate> [key]

Required aura:  one point for each character
Required item:  none
Time to cast:   three days

The caster will teleport through the specified gate.  The gate
must be present in the current location.  If the gate is sealed
with a key, the key must be supplied for the jump to succeed.

One point of aura is required for each figure jumping through
the gate.  For example, a magician stacked over a follower who
is accompanied by two peasants would require four aura points
to jump through a gate.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Seal gate [9117]

Usage:  USE 9117 <gate> <key>

Required aura:  six points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Seal the gate with the given key.  The gate must be present in
the current location, and must not already be sealed.

The key is a numeric password which will be required for further
access to the gate for jumps or other manipulations.  Only those
who supply the key number will be granted access.

    For example, if Gate [8192] is sealed with USE 9117 8192 123
    then the key "123" must be supplied as a parameter to the
    jump spell, or the jump will fail.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Unseal gate with key [9118]

Usage:  USE 9118 <gate> <key>

Required aura:  three points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days.

Remove the seal from a gate by supplying the key.  The key will
no longer be required for jumps through the gate.

    For example, if Gate [8192] were sealed with key "123",
    the spell USE 9118 8192 123 would unseal the gate.
    Jumps through the gate could proceed without supplying
    the key.

Required item:
Time to cast:   ten days

Clouds the target's mind with disturbing images and incoherent
thoughts.  The target mage will have difficulty achieving the
proper mental state during his next attempt at meditation.

The next meditate spell issued by the target may fail, resulting
in the mage not acquiring a point of current aura. The more aura
invested in 9175, the greater the chance the target mage will fail:

	aura	chance of failure
	----	-----------------
	 1	      50%
	 2	      75%
	 3	      90%

If the target does not meditate, the spell will lose one point
of aura at the end of each month until it has dissipated.  Casts
by multiple mages accumulate on the target, although the spell may
not accumulate more than three points of aura.

For example, if two mages each cast USE 9175 501 2, character [501]
will have a 90% chance of failure in his next attempt to meditate.
(One aura point has been wasted, since only three may accumulate on
the target).  At the end of the month, the strength of the 9175
spell against [501] will diminish to two points, and [501] will
have a 50% chance of failure during his next meditation.

A mage may cast multiple 9175 spells; they accumulate on the targets,
not on the casting magician.

9175 has no effect on non-magicians.

The default amount of aura is one point.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Forge palantir [9176]

Usage:  USE 9176

Required aura:   eight
Required items:  one mithril [82]
                 one gate crystal [83]
Time to cast:    ten days

A palantir, or stone of far-seeing, is a crystal orb used to
view images from a great distance.  Once created, the palantir
may be used to view a distant location:

	use <palantir> <location>

For example, if a USE 9176 creates Palantir [6289], then one may
view City of Drassa [cx61] with the palantir by issuing the order:

	use 6289 cx61

Use of the palantir takes seven days.  Any character may use the
palantir; no magical abilities are required.  However, a palantir
may only be used once each turn.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Save projected cast [9177]

Usage:  USE @@@@

Required aura:   three
Required item:
Time to cast:    seven days

The state where a mage's next cast will be projected to a different
location may be saved with this spell.  A potion will be created
which, upon use, will revive the projected cast state.

For example, a mage establishes that his next spell cast will be based
from Drassa [cx59].  He then issues USE @@@@ to preserve this state.
Magical potion [8764] is created.  He later issues USE 8764 to drink
the potion.  His next spell will be based from Drassa.

The mage will no longer have a projected cast state after use of this
spell.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Save speeded cast [9178]

Usage:  USE @@@@

Required aura:   three
Required item:
Time to cast:    seven days

The state where the mage's next cast will be speeded may be saved
with this spell.  A potion will be created which, upon use, will
revive the accelerated cast state.

For example, a mage establishes that his next spell cast will be
speeded by five days.  He then issues USE @@@@ to preserve this state.
Magical potion [8765] is created.  He later issues USE 8765 to drink
the potion.  He will gain a five day speedup for his next cast.

The mage will no longer have a speeded cast state after use of this
spell.

-----------------------------

Spell:  Teach spell [9179]

Notes:
======

Chars have max & current aura ratings.
Items may increase magical aura.
Max aura is increased along with knowledge level while studying.
Current aura rises to max aura at 1 pt/turn.
Actual effective aura rating may be augmented by a magical device.

Forge magical auracle / auracon / auraculum

perhaps a particular spell can only be cast once a month by *anyone*
who else knows this spell, spell
spells could wear out if used too often
who else knows this skill, dependent on:
how many other people know this skill

Disrupt magician's study
Disrupt magician's research
Cause zone of peace / mind rest / tranquility

spells can only be cast every N days...spell can't be cast on the same
twice on the same day...

Disrupt magic in region (too powerful?)
Disrupt cast <target>  -- region, much aura ; char, less aura
Enable cast no matter what

Perhaps casts fail without giving a reason if too many or disrupted
or wrong ingredients.

Sendings?
Resurrection?

Precast spell -- pay spell preparation time upfront (see Quicken ...)
Later spell will take zero time to actually cast (or one day)

Require mithril to construct a magical artifact?

Make subspell -- a copy of an existing spell, but one which
	- enslaves the caster
	- notifies the subspell's creator
	- doesn't work against the creator
	- can only be one copy of each spell
Reveal nature of spell
	- true spell
		whether a subspell has been created for it
	- subspell
		creator of subspell
	- days to regenerate
	- required knowledge
	- what magicians last attempted to cast it
	- how many magicians know it


Another possible rule:  once N magicians know a spell, it relocates
to a different entity number.  Problematic.


Make slave subspell
	doesn't work against creator
	notifies creator for each use
	limited pool -- don't allow continual growth

Reveal last use of spell	1 NP
	must know spell

	who (char *)
	when	teacher
	where	master



Spell Casting Limitations
-------------------------

Spells may only be cast n times per turn
	simpler
	but collision problem at beginning of month

Spells may only be cast within n days of one another
	more complex
	more random -- hard to tell when it's safe to cast a spell

Why?

1.
spell's power to cause effect in physical world comes from their
innate patters in the aural plane.  Casting a spell depeletes the
pattern of energy.  The stronger the spell, the longer it takes to
regenerate.

2.
All spells are fundamentally based on expressing the true name of
the desired effect in the aural plane.

No two magicians can cast the same spell at the same time.
(fail after one day for fairness?)
(phys: cast-attempt list in spell entity)

Basic:  Prevail over contesters / competitors for next cast

Once cast, a spell requires an amount of time to regenerate.
Each spell lists how many days it takes to regenerate.


Illusion:  Prophecy arrivals to this location
Gatecraft:  Inhibit jumps to region
Gatecraft:  Inhibit jumps from region

Spell:  Reflect cast (given who and spell, reflects cast back on them)

Knowledge of Runes of Evil [9154] allows the study of the following
additional spells which are based on powers granted by the Runes:

	Construct cursed death-scroll [9155]
	Teleport self [9156]


Inspect gate
	created by
	on
	Notify jump:
	Notify unseal:
	Seal key: ???
	Last jump:
	on:

Curse of the fives:  causes any spell with a '5' in the number
			to mysteriously fail

			implement via d_use, eh?

New magic ideas:

	Inspect gate
	Detect aura interference
	Sense aura ?

Very powerful:

	Dissipate mage's aura
	Sap mage's aura

Sacrifice nobles for NP's
	two nobles for one NP
	three nobles for two NP's


Artifacts:
	artifact which inhibits gate jumps if it's in the region

Locate shrouded regions

Scry:  Are there hidden features here?

	maybe
	yes
	no

Curse scroll use

Test magic potion (alchemy, magic?)
	1/3 chance that purpose will be revealed
	but repeated attempts do not change the answer


Forge auraculum
	requires lots of stuff: gold, gate crystal, cobalt fire powder, etc.
	notify other auraculum creators

	auraculum contains three spells you can't get anywhere else
		siphon mage's aura
		???
		???


Advanced sorcery
	Aura blast
	Drain aura
	Sacrifice nobles for NP's

Can noncreators use an auraculum's spells?

forge auraculum adds AS
	that is the one-time marker
	lore sheet
	auraculum possess gives req critical hit
	critical hit -- execute -- 50% fail chance

aura blast
	ineffective against non-magicians
	causes wounds after CA consumed

Dispel artifact curse
	no way to do this
	only way is if creator dies

Make FA take three turns?  Two turns?

Sap loyalty - aura points deducted
	but only against magicians, unless they
		use some other spell first
		have some other spell

Use health to meet current aura requirements
Perhaps CA depletion also depletes health, normally

bad Interaction between dip into health and Heal.

Instead of having some spells work directly, instead
have forge spells to construct an item which performs
the spell.


battle magic
	defensive spells require CA
	or just put in other categories
