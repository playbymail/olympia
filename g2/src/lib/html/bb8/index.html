Raise undead [904]
------------------
Usage:   COLLECT 31 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Undead [31] are dead bodies animated with foul magic, summoned
from their graves.  While not particularly swift or strong,
their horrifying nature often inspires terror amongst their
foes on the battlefield.  Thus they fight with combat rating
attack-10, defense-10.

One undead may be summoned per day from a graveyard.
Graveyards furnish up to 15 undead each month.

One or two undead may decompose at the end of each month.
