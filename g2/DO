DONE:
	Format of Join file is now
		Faction
		Primary character
		Starting city choice
		Player's full name
		Email address
	totimes-g2@pbm.com alias
	g2watch
	ordering of hidden locations is no longer sequential
	fix mapgen to use * for three start cities -- naming, etc.
	auraculuation doesn't reveal identity to others

	skills gone:
		160/9106	Speed cast
		160/9178	Save speeded cast
	9186 lets a mage absorb half of an aura blast

	250 orders max per unit

	Make Faery and Hades as big as the regular world (?) land only?

Movement penalty
----------------

Stacks with large numbers of men relative to the number of nobles
travel slower.  A movement penalty of:

	delay = number of men / (number of nobles * 10)

is imposed for stack movement.  For example, a stack with one noble
and 9 peasants will move in the rated time.  A stack with 10 peasants
and one noble will take an extra day to move.  A stack with 40 peasants
and 2 nobles will take two extra days, etc...


TODO:
	Create G2 join web form

	Make sure you can't civilize squares in faery or hades


Questions:
	Should G1 move to Thursday, and G2 run on Tuesday, or
	should both games run on Wednesday.  If both run on Wednesday,
	a single copy of the _Times_ could be produced, covering
	both games.
