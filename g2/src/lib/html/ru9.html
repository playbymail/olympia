Sailing [601]
-------------
Usage:  USE 601 <direction or location>
Or:     SAIL <direction or location>

Requires:  character must be ship's captain
Time:      varies with route taken

Pilot a ship in the given direction, or to the specified
location.  If a location is specified, there must be a direct
route to it from the current location of the ship.

Compass points may be abbreviated:  N, S, E, W.

The character issuing the Pilot ship order must occupy the
first position inside the ship (the character must be the
captain of the ship).

The captain must have a crew to assist in the handling of the
ship.  Galleys require fourteen sailors as oarsmen to row the ship.
Roundships require at least eight sailors to man the ship's rigging.

        ship            crew
        ----            ----
        galley          14 sailors
        roundship       8 sailors

If the required number of crew are not available, travel is still
possible, but will take an extra day for each hand the crew is short.

For example, a galley with only 10 men at the oars will take four
extra days to travel across an ocean route.  A roundship with no
sailors at all would take eight extra days to traverse a route.

Galleys perform equally well regardless of wind conditions.
Roundships may be becalmed and unable to travel.  In the presence
of favorable wind they will travel across ocean routes in half
the rated time.

Overloaded ships do not sail well.  They may take longer than
expected to travel across routes, and are almost certain to
capsize and sink in a storm.  Captains should be careful not
to leave port in a vessel carrying too much cargo.

For convenience, one may use the SAIL order rather than "USE 601".
Knowledge of Pilot ship [601] is still required, however.


Harvest yew [703]
-----------------
Usage:     YEW [number] [days]
Times:     as given or necessary
Requires:  at least one worker [11]

Workers enter a yew grove and select yew trees which are suitable for
collection.  Yew is used in the making of longbows.

Must be used in a yew grove.  Yew groves generate 5 yew [68] each month.

Examples:

    yew         # obtain as much yew as possible
    yew 1       # stop after getting 1 wood
    yew 0 4     # cut yew for four days

In all cases, yew harvesting will cease as soon as the grove's supply
of yew for the month has been exhausted.

YEW is an alias for COLLECT 68.
