Hello!

I've noticed that your participation in Olympia has waned recently.
(You may have even been auto-dropped by the Olympia engine).

This is an exit interview to find out why you lost interest in Olympia,
and what can be done to improve the game.

It would be helpful if you could let me know the main reason you
dropped out.  These can be lumped into two broad categories:

	You thought the games looked somewhat interesting, but other
	activities prevented you from playing.

	The game didn't appeal to you.

More specifically (just suggestions):

    Lack of time
	Really wanted to play, but just couldn't
	Was out of town
	Wasn't interesting enough to warrant spending time on it

    Not what I expected
	Wargaming/strategic aspects were too weak
	Thought there would be more roleplaying
	Didn't like the interface

    Boring/lack of interest
	Nothing to do
	Too difficult to achieve objectives
	Not enough inter-player interaction

Feel free to write a freeform answer if you like, or pick some of the
above lines.  I'm interested in improving the appeal of Olympia; any
helpful comments you could make would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
