Aura blast [909]
----------------
Usage:  USE 909 <target> [aura] [have-left]

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The mage directs a blast of raw energy at the target character.
The target will suffer two points of damage for each point of
aura used in the blast.  For example, USE 909 5201 25 would
send a blast of 25 aura at [5201], causing a 50 point wound.

If aura is zero, all available current aura will be used.  If
have-left is given, at least that much current aura will be
retained, and not used for the blast

It is not possible to aura blast between Hades, Faery and
the real world.


Absorb aura blast [911]
-----------------------
Usage:  USE 911 <flag>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   zero days

Knowledge of 911 will, by default, cause the mage to absorb any
blasts of aura instead of being harmed by them.  If absorbed,
half of the aura used in the blast will be added to the aura
of the mage being blasted.

Instead of absorbing aura, the blast may be reflected back to the
attacker.  To set this option, specify a flag of 1:

	use 911 1	# reflect aura blasts back at attacker
	use 911 0	# absorb aura blasts into current aura

Aura blasts may only be reflected once.  If a blast is reflected back
to an attacker with knowledge of 911, the attacker will be harmed,
and will not absorb or reflect the blast.
