Survive fatal wound [611]
-------------------------
Usage:   implicit

Knowledge of 611 confers the ability for a noble to survive
a wound which would be normally be fatal.  If the noble's
health reaches zero, either through combat or by other harm,
instead of dying the noble will be restored to full health.

Once the skill has been used, it is forgotten.  To survive
a second fatal would, the noble would have to spend another
Noble Point and study for three weeks to learn 611 again.
