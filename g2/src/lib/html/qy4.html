Fight to the death [612]
------------------------
Usage:   USE 612 <0|1>
Time:    0 days

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  Knowledge of 612 allows a leader to override
this default break point and set it to 100% instead.

    Break at 50% losses:   USE 612 1  (default)
    Fight to the death:    USE 612 0

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for 612 is checked.
612 works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.


Construct catapult [613]
------------------------
Usage:  USE 613

Requires:  three wood [77]
           three workers [11]

Produces:  one catapult [61]

Time:      fourteen days

The engineer directs the construction of a wheeled wooden frame
containing a mechanism to supply stress to the end of a long
wooden pole.  The pole contains a basket which may be loaded
with stones or other missiles to be hurled against the enemy's
walls, or over them.  A winch to lower the pole and a release
mechanism finish the siege engine.

Catapults are sometimes loaded with the bodies of the enemy's
dead and hurled over their walls, to dishearten the besieged and
spread disease amongst them.


Swordplay [616]
---------------
Usage:  USE 616
Time:   seven days

Use of 616 will cause the noble to spend time and effort practicing
swordplay, for use in personal combat.  Each seven-day use of 616
raises the noble's attack rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the time
the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and will
gain 10 points.

Knowledge of Swordplay also allows the noble to train swordsmen,
knights, and elite guards, via the TRAIN order.




Weaponsmithing [617]
--------------------
Usage:  MAKE  <item> <days>
Time:   as given

Weapons and armor are required for the training of some kinds of
fighters.  Archers require longbows, for instance, elite guard
require plate armor, etc.

Weapons and armor are made with the MAKE command.  The following
weapons and armor may be produced:

    num   item           material
    ---   ----           --------
     72   longbow        yew [68]
     73   plate armor    iron [79]
     74   longsword      iron [79]
     75   pike           wood [77]
     85   crossbow       wood [77]

One unit of the input material may turned into one of the desired
items each day.  For example, MAKE 72 2 would spend two days turning
two yew [68] into two longbows [72].

See the MAKE command for further information.
