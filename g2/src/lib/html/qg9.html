Determine inventory of character [632]
--------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 632 <character>
Time:   seven days

Sneakily learn the contents of the specified character's inventory.
The spy must be in the same location as the target.


Construct battering ram [701]
-----------------------------
Usage:  USE 701

Requires:  three wood [77]
           one iron [79]
           three workers [11]

Produces:  one battering ram [60]

Time:      fourteen days

The craftsman constructs a battering ram by selecting a large,
heavy tree trunk, sharpening the end somewhat and plating it
with iron, and then suspending it in a movable wooden frame
such that it may be swung back and forth against walls or gates.

The frame receives an iron plated roof to protect the operators
from boiling oil or pitch, rocks, or other missile weapons hurled
down upon them by the enemy.


Mine iron [721]
---------------
Usage:  USE 721

Requires:  ten workers
Time:      7 days

Iron is widely used in the making of weapons and armor.  It
is a required component of many of the weaponsmithing skill
uses, and is also used for applying a metal tip to galley
rams and battering rams.  An iron roof provides a protective
cover for siege towers.

The character must be in a mine shaft to USE 721.  The mine's
monthly yield of iron will be obtained.  Once mined, no further
iron can be mined until the next month.

Use of this skill will cause the mine shaft to become one-third
of a level deeper.

The quantity of iron obtained will vary with the depth of the
shaft.  The largest deposits of iron are usually found in
shallow mines.
