Shipbuilding [602]
------------------
Usage:     BUILD galley "Name of ship"
or         BUILD roundship "Name of ship"

Requires:  at least three workers [11]
	   50 wood [77] for a galley, 100 wood for a roundship

Time:      250 worker-days for a galley, 500 for a roundship

To begin construction of a ship, the shipbuilder should unstack from
beneath other characters and issue one of the BUILD orders.  One-fifth
of the lumber is required to start construction.  The rest is deducted
as progress on the ship is made (the second fifth at 20% completion,
the third fifth at 40% completion, etc.)

The shipbuilder and his workers will be placed inside the new ship.

As soon as the required number of worker-days has been invested in
construction, the ship will be christened and declared seaworthy.

To resume construction of a partially completed ship, first enter the
ship, then issue the either "build galley" or "build roundship".

Ships may only be built in locations with a passable route to an
ocean, such as a port city.


Mine mithril [723]
------------------
Usage:  USE 723

Requires:  ten workers
Time:      7 days

Mithril is a magical metal used in the by the ancient
elf-lords to construct their bright, fearsome weapons.
Today mithril is the component of some rare construction
skills.

The character must be in a mine shaft to USE 723.  The mine's
monthly yield of mithril will be obtained.  Once mined, no
further mithril can be mined until the next month.

Use of this skill will cause the mine shaft to become one-third
of a level deeper.

The quantity of mithril obtained will vary with the depth of the
shaft.  Mithril is usually found only in very deep mines.  As
the dangers of poison gasses or collapse of the mine shaft increase
with depth, mithril mining tends to be risky.
