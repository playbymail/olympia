Receive vision [751]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 751 <target>
Time:   ten days

Receive a vision of a character, place or unique item.  A
character may only see a vision for a particular target once.

Visions will fail if the target is in a different world than
the priest, i.e. if the priest is in the normal world, but
the target is in Faery or Hades.

Each attempt to receive a vision has a 50% chance of success.
