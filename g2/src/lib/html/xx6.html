Perform common tasks for gold [802]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 802 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.
This skill allows the magician to perform trivial or common tasks for
the local population of a city or province to earn gold.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love
potions, dowsing for water, or performing conjuring tricks.

This skill earns 10 gold per day for the mage, while work at common
tasks is available.  Cities and provinces support 5 days of work at
common tasks for each point of civilization level.  For example, a
civ-2 city will allow a mage to work for 10 days at common tasks,
earning 100 gold.

If multiple mages work the same location, they compete for the
available work.  Two mages who each began using 802 on the first
day of the month in a civ-2 province would each work for five days,
and each would earn 50 gold.  See the COLLECT order for more details
regarding competition for resources.
