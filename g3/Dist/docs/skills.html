<PRE>Shipcraft [600]  three weeks
-----------------------------
All skills concerning ocean travel fall under this category.
Shipcraft encompasses the building and repair of ships,
training of sailors, and navigation at sea.

The following skills may be studied directly once Shipcraft is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn

<div class="details">
<PRE>Sailing [601] two weeks
-----------------------
Usage:  USE 601 &lt;direction or location&gt;
Or:     SAIL &lt;direction or location&gt;

Requires:  character must be ship's captain
Time:      varies with route taken

Pilot a ship in the given direction, or to the specified
location.  If a location is specified, there must be a direct
route to it from the current location of the ship.

Compass points may be abbreviated:  N, S, E, W.

The character issuing the Pilot ship order must occupy the
first position inside the ship (the character must be the
captain of the ship).

The captain must have a crew to assist in the handling of the
ship.  Galleys require fourteen sailors as oarsmen to row the ship.
Roundships require at least eight sailors to man the ship's rigging.

        ship            crew
        ----            ----
        galley          14 sailors
        roundship       8 sailors

If the required number of crew are not available, travel is still
possible, but will take an extra day for each hand the crew is short.

For example, a galley with only 10 men at the oars will take four
extra days to travel across an ocean route.  A roundship with no
sailors at all would take eight extra days to traverse a route.

Galleys perform equally well regardless of wind conditions.
Roundships may be becalmed and unable to travel.  In the presence
of favorable wind they will travel across ocean routes in half
the rated time.

Overloaded ships do not sail well.  They may take longer than
expected to travel across routes, and are almost certain to
capsize and sink in a storm.  Captains should be careful not
to leave port in a vessel carrying too much cargo.

For convenience, one may use the SAIL order rather than "USE 601".
Knowledge of Pilot ship [601] is still required, however.

<PRE>Shipbuilding [602] two weeks
---------------------------
Usage:     BUILD galley "Name of ship"
or         BUILD roundship "Name of ship"

Requires:  at least three workers [11]
	   50 wood [77] for a galley, 100 wood for a roundship

Time:      250 worker-days for a galley, 500 for a roundship

To begin construction of a ship, the shipbuilder should unstack from
beneath other characters and issue one of the BUILD orders.  One-fifth
of the lumber is required to start construction.  The rest is deducted
as progress on the ship is made (the second fifth at 20% completion,
the third fifth at 40% completion, etc.)

The shipbuilder and his workers will be placed inside the new ship.

As soon as the required number of worker-days has been invested in
construction, the ship will be christened and declared seaworthy.

To resume construction of a partially completed ship, first enter the
ship, then issue the either "build galley" or "build roundship".

Ships may only be built in a port city.

Usage:     FISH [number of fish] [days]
Requires:  at least one sailor

Unit must be on a ship on the ocean in order to fish.  Each day
spent fishing there is a 50% chance that the ship will come across
a school of fish.  If fish are found, each sailor will produce one
fish that day.  Provinces generate 50 fish per month which may be
obtained by fishing.

Examples:

    fish         # obtain as many fish as possible
    fish 25      # stop after getting 25 fish
    fish 0 5     # fish for five days
    fish 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 fish, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, fishing will cease as soon as the stocks in the ocean
province have been exhausted.

Usage:   implicit

Knowledge of 611 confers the ability for a noble to survive
a wound which would be normally be fatal.  If the noble's
health reaches zero, either through combat or by other harm,
instead of dying the noble will be restored to full health.

Once the skill has been used, it is forgotten.  To survive

<PRE>Fight to the death [612] four weeks
-----------------------------------
Usage:   USE 612 &lt;0|1&gt;
Time:    0 days

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  Knowledge of 612 allows a leader to override
this default break point and set it to 100% instead.

    Break at 50% losses:   USE 612 1  (default)
    Fight to the death:    USE 612 0

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for 612 is checked.
612 works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.

Time:      fourteen days

The engineer directs the construction of a wheeled wooden frame
containing a mechanism to supply stress to the end of a long
wooden pole.  The pole contains a basket which may be loaded
with stones or other missiles to be hurled against the enemy's
walls, or over them.  A winch to lower the pole and a release
mechanism finish the siege engine.

Catapults are sometimes loaded with the bodies of the enemy's
dead and hurled over their walls, to dishearten the besieged and

<PRE>Petty thievery [631] two weeks
------------------------------
Usage:  USE 631
Time:   seven days

The skill of the common burglar, 631 allows a thief to work a
city for gold.  The thief may pick pockets, steal from merchants
in the market, enter homes in search of loot, or deceive townsfolk
into parting with their gold with confidence games.

631 may only be used in a city, where there are many opportunities
for the petty thief.  Since reports of thievery tend to make the
city residents tense and alert, 631 may only be used once per month
in each city.

A thief will earn between 50 and 150 gold for each successful use of
631.  There is a 5% chance that instead of obtaining gold, the thief
will be caught and beaten, and receive a 5-15 point health loss.

The amount of gold the thief obtains from the city is deducted from
the city's tax base for the month.

Cities which have recently been pillaged offer no opportunities for
petty thievery, as the residents have already been stripped of their
valuables, and are wary of strangers.

Knowledge of 635 causes a character to keep its faction affiliation
secret.  Other units attempting to learn the what player the unit

Permissions set for the player of a character concealing its faction
affiliation will not include the character.  For example, suppose
unit [5499] is concealing the fact that it belongs to player [613].
Permissions declared for player [613] (such as ADMIT, DEFEND, etc.)
will not include the sneaky unit [5499], since [5499] will not admit
to an affiliation with [613].

Furthermore, such units will not DEFEND units from their own faction

Torture is the practice of inflicting pain on a captive prisoner in

Usage:  USE 638 &gt;flag&lt;
Time:   three days

This skill allows a character to conceal itself from view.
When activiated, other characters will not see the unit in their
location reports, and will not see the unit come and go.

The unit must be alone in order to conceal itself.  It may not be
stacked with any other characters, or possess any followers, such
as peasants, soldiers, workers, or anything else that can engage
in combat.  It may also not be the first character inside a
sublocation, building or ship.  The owners of these small
locations are always visible.

Hiding takes three days to accomplish.  However, turning off
concealment takes zero time.

Use of the skill will set whether or not the unit is trying to
hide from view:

	use 638 1	# Hide from view, takes three days
	use 638 0	# Don't conceal self from view, zero days

Note that attempts to gain entrance to buildings or ships with

<a href="#s652">Capture beasts in battle [652]</a>
<div class="details">
<PRE>Capture beasts in battle [652] four weeks
-----------------------------------------
Usage:  automatic when needed

Wild animals will ordinarily fight to the death.  Nobles who enter
combat with these creatures must either kill them, or be killed
themselves.

Beastmasters with knowledge of 652, however, can capture rather
than kill these wild animals.  The skilled beastmaster will lure
the animal into a trap, or carefully engage it until the beast
becomes exhausted.  If a group of many beasts is attacked, most
beasts will die during battle, leaving a few (or sometimes none)
for the beastmaster to capture.

652 is used automatically whenever the character attacks (or is
attacked by) one of the following wild beasts:

    nazgul [55]
    centaur [271]
    minotaur [272]
    giant spider [278]
    rat [279]
    lion [280]
    giant bird [281]
    giant lizard [282]
    chimera [284]
    harpie [285]
    dragon [286]
    gorgon [288]
    wolf [289]

To capture wild beasts, the noble should ATTACK them.  A regular
combat will occur, and the noble's stack may suffer casualties.
652 does not change the progress of battle, or the outcome if
the noble loses.

If the noble is victorious, however, instead of the wild beasts
being destroyed, their unit wrapper will be disbanded, and the
beast items will be added to the noble's inventory.

The beastmaster need not be the stack leader for 652 to work.
However, the stack leader will always receive the booty.

-------------------------------------
Usage:  automatic when needed

This skill grants the beastmaster the ability to control animals
in battle.  Any wild animals in the possession of the beastmaster
will be treated as additional fighters.

For example, a character with 10 soldiers [12] and one lion [280]
who did not know 653 would only use the soldiers in battle.
However, a beastmaster with knowledge of 653 would also employ
the lion in combat.

Only the beasts directly possessed by the beastmaster will aid
combat.  Animals owned by units which do not possess knowledge
of 653 will not be used in battle.

The following animals may be used in combat:

    nazgul [55]          (80,80,0)
    centaur [271]        (30,30,0)
    minotaur [272]       (30,5,0)

Usage:  BREED &lt;ITEM&gt; &lt;ITEM&gt;
Time:   varies

Attempt to breed two animals together to produce an offspring.
Not all animals produce successful offspring.  Occasionally,
cross-breeding different beasts will produce strange results.

For example:

	To breed two wild horses together:

		BREED 51 51

	To attempt a cross-breed of a horse and an ox:

		BREED 51 76

Because some animals are often unpredictable and violent, there
is a 20% chance that one of the breeding parents will be killed
in the attempt.

The time necessary for the BREED command to function is
dependent on the type of animal produced:
 
     beast                   days
     -----                   ----

A unit must know the Catch wild horses [655] subskill of

---------------------------------
Usage:  USE 658
        MAKE 98 1
Time:   one day

Wild men, or savages, inhabit remote parts of the world.  Savages
communicate by beating their drums to indicate calls-to-arms,
battle challenges, or victory celebrations.

Use of 658 will attempt to summon wild men with drumbeats, and
persuade them to stack with the noble.  Savages will remain with
the noble for 3 months, during which time they will participate
in any battles the noble fights.

To summon wild men, the noble must first use the MAKE 98 1 order
to produce a drum [98].  A drum requires 1 mallorn wood [70] to
produce.  MAKE 98 1 requires knowledge of 658.

The drum may be used to summon wild men with the USE 658 order.
The noble should be in a remote province, preferably surrounded by
areas uninhabited by other characters.  The noble should allow time
for the savage men to hear and follow the drumbeats.  Any wild men
summoned to the province will stack with the noble.

For example:

	make 98 1	# make a drum
	use 658	        # use the drum to summon the savages
	wait time 15	# give savages time to arrive and
			# stack with us

The number of savage units in the world is limited.  If all of the
available savages have already been summoned, none will come when
the drum is used.

Usage:   BRIBE &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;GOLD&gt; [flag]
Time:    seven days

Offer a character gold in an attempt to win their service.  The
amount must be at least 250 gold, or the receiving noble will not
consider it a serious offer.

Nobles with oathbound loyalty ignore bribes.  They may accept the
gift, but they will not renounce loyalty to their lord.

Nobles with contract loyalty will consider the bribe if it meets
or exceeds their current loyalty rating.  For example, a noble of
loyalty contract-750 would ignore any bribe of less than 750 gold.

Nobles with fear loyalty, or nobles not sworn to any lord, will
seriously consider any bribe of at least 250 gold.

If the receiving noble considers the bribe, there is a 33% chance
they will renounce loyalty to their current lord, and swear fealty
to the bribing character.  There is also a chance that they will
report the bribe or pocket it for themselves.  In some cases they
may even renounce loyalty to their lord, but not swear fealty to
the briber, instead choosing to go off on their own.

Characters who are successfully bribed will have loyalty contract-250
to the bribing character.  If flag is 1, and the bribe attempt is
successful, the bribed character will stack with the briber.

Bribes will be refused by characters who have already switched
lords during the month because of bribery.  For example, suppose
Osswid successfully bribes Feasel, and Feasel swears loyalty to
Osswid.  Later that turn, if Procrustes attempts to bribe Feasel,
Feasel will refuse to accept the bribe.

The bribing character will lose the number of NPs which have
been invested in the bribed character if the bribe is successful.
The previous owner of a bribed noble will have the invested NPs
returned.

Examples:

    bribe 5499 750	# Offer [5499] 750 gold to switch factions.
			# If successful, [5499] will not stack with the
			# briber.

    bribe 3409 300 1	# Offer [3409] 300 gold to switch factions.

672 costs 25 gold per use, to pay for gifts, fine meals, handsome

to any character which drinks it.

Upon completion, the potion will be added to the alchemist's
inventory.  The potion's label will not reveal its sinister
purpose.

A character wishing to drink the potion should specify it
to the USE order.  For instance, to drink potion [603], issue
the order:  USE 603.

Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love

This skill earns 10 gold per day for the mage, while work at common
tasks is available.  Cities and provinces support 5 days of work at
common tasks for each point of civilization level.  For example, a

Clouds the target's mind with disturbing images and incoherent

The next meditate spell issued by the target may fail, resulting

Hinder meditation [814] directed against mages using Advanced
Meditiation [9174] will cause them to only gain half of the
normal aura obtained.

If the target does not meditate, the spell will lose one point
of aura at the end of each month until it has dissipated.  Casts
by multiple mages accumulate on the target, although the spell may
not accumulate more than five points of aura.

For example, if two mages each cast USE 814 501 3, character [501]
will have a 90% chance of failure in his next attempt to meditate.
(One aura point has been wasted, since only five may accumulate on
the target).  At the end of the month, the strength of the 814
spell against [501] will diminish by one point, and [501] will
have a 75% chance of failure during his next meditation.

A mage may cast multiple 814 spells; they accumulate on the targets,
not on the casting magician.

814 has no effect on non-magicians.

The default amount of aura is one point.

Erects a magical barrier which prevents anyone from entering the
location.  The barrier will lose one point of aura at the end of
each turn, and will dissipate when it has no aura remaining.

For example, USE 845 1 will create a barrier over the location
which lasts until the end of the turn.  USE 845 2 will create
a barrier which lasts until the end of the next turn.

Multiple casts of 845 are additive.

A barrier which achieves eight points of aura becomes permanent.
Permanent barriers do not decay at the end of each month.  They
may only be removed by a magician.

Knowledge of 848 will inform the mage of attempts made by other

The projected cast state will persist until the mage's next use
of magic.  The mage may move before casting the next spell;
movement will not alter the target location for spell projection.

a magical shroud over the target location will cause this

<PRE>Gatecraft [860] five weeks 1 NP
----------------------------------
Long ago the Ancients, a race of wise men who ruled the land with
the aid of powerful magic, constructed a network of teleportation
gateways to connect distant cities.  As the reach of their magical
portals grew, so grew the reach of their armies and knowledge.  At
their height the rule of the Ancients extended to every corner of
the known world, and beyond.

With the passing of the Ancients, the system of gates fell into
disuse and decay, and now retains only a hint of its former majesty.
Gatecraft, once practiced by the most common among the Ancients, has
since been forgotten by nearly all men.

The school of Gatecraft retains the only knowledge of the use of
these mystical portals.  Because knowledge of Gates can be a powerful
tool or weapon, Gatecraft spells are jealously guarded even within
the school.  Some aspects of Gatecraft, such as the secret of their
construction, have been completely lost.

The following skills may be studied directly once Gatecraft is known:

Most mages believed that returning to the starting location

However, it is possible to jump back to a gate from the gate's

difficult, so the jump requires twice as much aura as a

As with a conventional jump, the mage must know the gate's

---------------------
Usage:  USE 881 &lt;aura-level&gt; "Name"

Required aura:   as specified by caster
Required items:  500 gold, 1 mithril
Time to cast:    fourteen days

Forge a magical auraculum, giving it the specified name.

   An auraculum is a magical artifact which concentrates and amplifies
   a mage's power.  A permanent investment of maximum aura is made when
   constructing the auraculum.  The artifact doubles the invested aura.
   However, since a portion of the mage's pneuma has been bound in the
   auraculum, it is important to safeguard it from being lost or stolen.

In addition to depleting the caster's current aura level, the specified
aura amount will be permanently removed from the magician's maximum aura
rating.  The new object, while possessed by its maker, will augment the
mage's maximum aura rating by twice the amount of aura invested in its
creation.

Possession of an auraculum doubles the amount of aura a mage naturally
recovers each month, from two points to four.

Creation of an auraculum also grants knowledge of the Advanced sorcery
magical skill category.  Advanced sorcery may not be learned in any
other way.

Example:

   A mage of current aura level 10, maximum aura 10 who issues
   USE 881 5 "Ring of power" will be reduced to current aura level 5,
   maximum aura level 5.  However, the new artifact will add 10 points
   to the maximum aura rating of its creator, but only while it is in
   his possession.

       Current aura:   10
       Maximum aura:   10

    1: &gt; use 881 5 "Ring of power"
    1: Attempt to forge an auraculum.
       ...
   14: Created Ring of power [js80].
   14: Learned Advanced sorcery [920].

       Current aura:   5
       Maximum aura:   15 (5+10)
 
Characters other than the auraculum's creator do not receive an aura
bonus from possession of the object.

Since the mage has bound a portion of his aura into the artifact, its
destruction would deal him an instant, fatal blow.  Thus, the creator
of such an object should use all means to prevent it from being lost
or stolen.  However, magical items of such power are hard to destroy.
An auraculum may only be destroyed in the province in which it was
created.

This spell may only be used once.  A magician may only create one
auraculum during his lifetime.

The creator of the artifact may change its name later with the
NAME order.  The object must be possessed in order to rename it.

   &gt; name js80 "Wooden staff"
   Ring of power [js80] will now be known as Wooden staff [js80].

<PRE>Necromancy [900] six weeks 2 NP
-------------------------------
The way of the necromancer leads to fresh graves, the pits of Hades,
and unspeakable horrors found only in dark corners of men's souls.

Power is gained through animation and enslavement of the dead, both
followers as well as nobles.  A necromancer looks upon a bloody
battlefield strewn with the dead as a potential army waiting to be
trained.

Advanced necromancers wield fierce powers, manipulating evil Runes
to effect their will upon the world, and making pacts with demons
to obtain power in return for souls.

With great power also comes great danger, and necromancy is the most
dangerous of the magical arts.  Only those willing to risk death at
the hands of civilized men, or worse fates meted out by demons sent
from the underworld, should even consider its study.

The following skills may be studied directly once Necromancy is known:

Undead [31] are dead bodies animated with foul magic, summoned
from their graves.  While not particularly swift or strong,
their horrifying nature often inspires terror amongst their
foes on the battlefield.  Thus they fight with combat rating
attack-10, defense-10.

One undead may be summoned per day from a graveyard.
Graveyards furnish up to 15 undead each month.

Each day of summoning requires one point of aura, and yields two
ghost warriors.

Ghost warriors [18] are spirits of dead soldiers summoned to fight
again on the battlefield.  They have no substance, and thus are
ineffectual attackers.  Opponents will still select them in combat,
however, so they are useful for absorbing enemy hits.

Ghost warriors have a attack and defense values of zero.  One hit
by any attacker will cause them to vanish.

One ghost warrior returns to the Land of the Dead at the end of

Required item:  blank scroll [84]
Time to cast:   seven or more days

The most basic and powerful of the magical languages, Runes of Evil
may represent vast power.  Descended from neither man or spirit,
they represent the fundamental Commands which shape the world and
its events.  They may represent concepts which men are incapable of
speaking, or even thinking.

Transcribe the given spell onto a blank scroll.  The blank scroll will
be consumed, and a new unique scroll will be produced.  The scroll will
permit one character to learn the spell from the scroll.

Example:

    USE 903 nnnn       # make a one-time study scroll for spell nnnn

Only Necromancy [900] spells may be scribed with this skill.

The spell must be known by the character in order to be written.
The character will still know the spell after it has been scribed.

This spell requires as much time to cast as the skill takes to learn.
It takes two weeks to write a spell which requires two weeks of study

Usage:  USE 904 [aura]

Required aura:  three to eight points
Time to cast:   seven days

Summon a demon lord unit from a graveyard.  The demon lord will
appear with 15-25 undead and stack with the summoner.

Each graveyard will support the summoning of one demon lord.  No
further demon lord units may be summoned from a graveyard until
the graveyard's demon lord has been destroyed or banished.

The amount of aura invested in the summoning determines the
strength of the demon lord.  The default aura is three points.

	aura	attack/defense
	----	--------------
	 3	  (100,100)
	 4	  (150,150)
	 5	  (190,190)
	 6	  (220,220)
	 7	  (240,240)
	 8	  (250,250)

Each undead accompanying the demon lord fights with attack-10,
defense-10.

The demon lord's service is secured with a bond which lasts five
months, unless renewed.  Demon lords should be banished or have
their bonds renewed before the five months expires, or they may
exercise their wrath on the summoner.

Other Necromatic spells provide for banishment of demon lords and
renewal of their loyalty bonds.

The mage directs a blast of raw energy at the target character.
The target will suffer two points of damage for each point of
aura used in the blast.  For example, USE 908 5201 25 would
send a blast of 25 aura at [5201], causing a 50 point wound.

If aura is zero, all available current aura will be used.  If
have-left is given, at least that much current aura will be

Knowledge of 909 will, by default, cause the mage to absorb any
blasts of aura instead of being harmed by them.  If absorbed,
half of the aura used in the blast will be added to the aura

Instead of absorbing aura, the blast may be reflected back to the
attacker.  To set this option, specify a flag of 1:

	use 909 1	# reflect aura blasts back at attacker
	use 909 0	# absorb aura blasts into current aura

Aura blasts may only be reflected once.  If a blast is reflected back
to an attacker with knowledge of 909, the attacker will be harmed,
and will not absorb or reflect the blast.

Required aura:   three points + one per 50 weight
Time to cast:    three days

Teleport quantity of an item in inventory to another character.
Specifying zero for quantity will cause the unit to teleport all
of its inventory of the item.  An amount specified by have-left
will be retained.

For example, if Feasel has 100 gold [1]:

        USE 922 5499 1 0           #  Send all 100 gold to [5499]
