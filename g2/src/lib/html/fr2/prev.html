Construct siege tower [681]
---------------------------
Usage:  USE 681

Requires:  three wood [77]
           three leather [80]
           three workers [11]

Produces:  one seige tower [62]

Time:      fourteen days

The engineer directs three workers to build a wooden tower,
covered with treated leather skins or iron plating to protect
the tower from burning.  The tower contains several ladders
and a platform from which soldiers may attack.

In battle, the tower is wheeled up against an enemy's walls
and used by attacking soldiers to match the height of the
defenders.  The attackers may then climb from the tower onto
the walls.


Teleport [861]
--------------
Usage:  USE 861 <location>

Required aura:  one point for each 50 weight
Required item:  gate crystal [83]
Time to cast:   one day

This skill allows a mage to teleport to the given location without
a gate.  A gate crystal is required to fuel the jump.  The gate
crystal is consumed by the jump.

One point of aura is required for each 50 units of weight in the
caster's stack to be transported.

Teleportation between the netherworlds (Hades & Faery) and
the real world is not possible.
