Combat [610]
------------
The student of combat learns the training of soldiers and how
to lead them well in battle.  With study and experience, the
battle lord will find strategies to be used in difficult combat
situations.

The following skills may be studied directly once Combat is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   611    Survive fatal wound                four weeks
   612    Fight to the death                 four weeks
   613    Construct catapult                 two weeks
   614    Defense                            two weeks
   615    Archery                            three weeks
   616    Swordplay                          two weeks
   617    Weaponsmithing                     two weeks



Fight to the death [612]
------------------------
Usage:   USE 612 <0|1>
Time:    0 days

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  Knowledge of 612 allows a leader to override
this default break point and set it to 100% instead.

    Break at 50% losses:   USE 612 1  (default)
    Fight to the death:    USE 612 0

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for 612 is checked.
612 works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.
