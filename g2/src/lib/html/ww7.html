Shipbuilding [602]
------------------
Usage:     BUILD galley "Name of ship"
or         BUILD roundship "Name of ship"

Requires:  at least three workers [11]
	   50 wood [77] for a galley, 100 wood for a roundship

Time:      250 worker-days for a galley, 500 for a roundship

To begin construction of a ship, the shipbuilder should unstack from
beneath other characters and issue one of the BUILD orders.  One-fifth
of the lumber is required to start construction.  The rest is deducted
as progress on the ship is made (the second fifth at 20% completion,
the third fifth at 40% completion, etc.)

The shipbuilder and his workers will be placed inside the new ship.

As soon as the required number of worker-days has been invested in
construction, the ship will be christened and declared seaworthy.

To resume construction of a partially completed ship, first enter the
ship, then issue the either "build galley" or "build roundship".

Ships may only be built in locations with a passable route to an
ocean, such as a port city.


Survive fatal wound [611]
-------------------------
Usage:   implicit

Knowledge of 611 confers the ability for a noble to survive
a wound which would be normally be fatal.  If the noble's
health reaches zero, either through combat or by other harm,
instead of dying the noble will be restored to full health.

Once the skill has been used, it is forgotten.  To survive
a second fatal would, the noble would have to spend another
Noble Point and study for three weeks to learn 611 again.


Defense [614]
-------------
Usage:  USE 614

Time:   seven days

The noble will spend time and effort practicing skills and
techniques of personal and combat defense.  Each use of 614
raises the noble's defense rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the
time the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and
will gain 10 points.


Perform common tasks for gold [802]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 802 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.
This skill allows the magician to perform trivial or common tasks for
the local population of a city or province to earn gold.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love
potions, dowsing for water, or performing conjuring tricks.

This skill earns 10 gold per day for the mage, while work at common
tasks is available.  Cities and provinces support 5 days of work at
common tasks for each point of civilization level.  For example, a
civ-2 city will allow a mage to work for 10 days at common tasks,
earning 100 gold.

If multiple mages work the same location, they compete for the
available work.  Two mages who each began using 802 on the first
day of the month in a civ-2 province would each work for five days,
and each would earn 50 gold.  See the COLLECT order for more details
regarding competition for resources.
