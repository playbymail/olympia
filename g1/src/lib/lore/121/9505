#Skill:  Fight to the death [9505]
Usage:   USE @@@@ <break-point>
Time:    0 days

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  Knowledge of @@@@ allows a leader to override
this default break point and set it to any value between 0 and 100.

A break point of zero means that a side will not break, and will
fight until the last man has been killed.  A break point of 100
means the side will break immediately after the first volley of
attacks is launched.

    Default setting:      USE @@@@ 50
    Fight to the death:   USE @@@@ 0
    Break at 30:          USE @@@@ 30

Note that "break at 30%" means that the side will break when its
offensive plus defensive total falls to 30% of its original value.

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for @@@@ is checked.
@@@@ works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.
