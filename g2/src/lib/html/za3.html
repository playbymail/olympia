Necromancy [900]
----------------
The way of the necromancer leads to fresh graves, the pits of Hades,
and unspeakable horrors found only in dark corners of men's souls.

Power is gained through animation and enslavement of the dead, both
followers as well as nobles.  A necromancer looks upon a bloody
battlefield strewn with the dead as a potential army waiting to be
trained.

Advanced necromancers wield fierce powers, manipulating evil Runes
to effect their will upon the world, and making pacts with demons
to obtain power in return for souls.

With great power also comes great danger, and necromancy is the most
dangerous of the magical arts.  Only those willing to risk death at
the hands of civilized men, or worse fates meted out by demons sent
from the underworld, should even consider its study.

The following skills may be studied directly once Necromancy is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------

   902    Runes of Evil                      three weeks
   903    Summon ghost warriors              three weeks

Further skills may be found through research.
