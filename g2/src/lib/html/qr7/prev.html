Sailing [601]
-------------
Usage:  USE 601 <direction or location>
Or:     SAIL <direction or location>

Requires:  character must be ship's captain
Time:      varies with route taken

Pilot a ship in the given direction, or to the specified
location.  If a location is specified, there must be a direct
route to it from the current location of the ship.

Compass points may be abbreviated:  N, S, E, W.

The character issuing the Pilot ship order must occupy the
first position inside the ship (the character must be the
captain of the ship).

The captain must have a crew to assist in the handling of the
ship.  Galleys require fourteen sailors as oarsmen to row the ship.
Roundships require at least eight sailors to man the ship's rigging.

        ship            crew
        ----            ----
        galley          14 sailors
        roundship       8 sailors

If the required number of crew are not available, travel is still
possible, but will take an extra day for each hand the crew is short.

For example, a galley with only 10 men at the oars will take four
extra days to travel across an ocean route.  A roundship with no
sailors at all would take eight extra days to traverse a route.

Galleys perform equally well regardless of wind conditions.
Roundships may be becalmed and unable to travel.  In the presence
of favorable wind they will travel across ocean routes in half
the rated time.

Overloaded ships do not sail well.  They may take longer than
expected to travel across routes, and are almost certain to
capsize and sink in a storm.  Captains should be careful not
to leave port in a vessel carrying too much cargo.

For convenience, one may use the SAIL order rather than "USE 601".
Knowledge of Pilot ship [601] is still required, however.


Harvest lumber [702]
--------------------
Usage:     WOOD [number] [days]
Time:      as given or necessary
Requires:  at least one worker [11]

Workers enter the forest and select trees which are suitable for felling
and sawing.  Lumber is used in the construction of ships, buildings and
some weapons.  Timber is also used to support the roofs of mine shafts.

Must be used in a forest province.  Forests generate 30 wood [77] each
month.

Examples:

    wood         # obtain as much wood as possible
    wood 25      # stop after getting 25 wood
    wood 0 5     # cut timber for five days
    wood 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 wood, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, timber cutting will cease as soon as the forest's supply
of wood for the month has been exhausted.

WOOD is an alias for COLLECT 77.


Conceal identity of trader [731]
--------------------------------
Usage:  BUY  <item> <qty> <price> <have-left> 1
        SELL <item> <qty> <price> <have-left> 1

This skill allows a trader to conceal his identity when
dealing with a market.  By working through middlemen and
employing shady contacts, the trader will not reveal his
identity to the other party to his transaction, or to the
market at large.

To use this skill, the trader should supply a "1" flag as
the fifth argument to the BUY or SELL command.  Note that
The first four arguments must be specified; use "0" for
have-left if it is to be left as the default.

For example, to conceal one's identity when selling 10
pots for 2 gold each, issue the order:

	sell 95 10 2 0 1

If the conceal trade flag is supplied, but the character
does not know 731, the BUY or SELL order will fail.


Find tradegood for sale [732]
-----------------------------
Usage:  USE 732
Time:   21 days

Use of 732 searches for a seller of a new rare
tradegood in the city market.  At the completion of use,
a new tradegood will be created and offered for sale by
the city.

Up to two tradegoods may be sold by each market.
Use of 732 will fail if there are already two rare
tradegoods for sale in the city.

The tradegood will remain for sale in the city for
24-36 months following its addition to the trade list.
At the end of this period it will be removed and no
longer offered for sale (lowering the count of tradegoods
sold in the city by 1).

732 must be used in a city in part of the regular world
(not Hades, Faery, the Cloudlands, or Subworld.)

Markets for rare tradegoods created with 732 may be
found via the skill Find market for tradegood [733].


Perform common tasks for gold [802]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 802 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.
This skill allows the magician to perform trivial or common tasks for
the local population of a city or province to earn gold.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love
potions, dowsing for water, or performing conjuring tricks.

This skill earns 10 gold per day for the mage, while work at common
tasks is available.  Cities and provinces support 5 days of work at
common tasks for each point of civilization level.  For example, a
civ-2 city will allow a mage to work for 10 days at common tasks,
earning 100 gold.

If multiple mages work the same location, they compete for the
available work.  Two mages who each began using 802 on the first
day of the month in a civ-2 province would each work for five days,
and each would earn 50 gold.  See the COLLECT order for more details
regarding competition for resources.
