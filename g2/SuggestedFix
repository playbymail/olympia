Part A of the bug is that you can terrorize a noble with "Survive
Fatal Wound" and easily get long-term fear nobles -- you don't even
need healing potions.

Part B of the bug is that you can terrorize for 999 or 9999 and
get infinite fear loyalty, again using Survive Fatal.

The trivial fix to B is to restrict terrorize to at most 99 points.

The fix to A is to make fear loyalty nobles who die and Survive Fatal
have at most fear-10 loyalty.
