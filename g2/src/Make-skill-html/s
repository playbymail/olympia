Gatecraft [860]
---------------
Long ago the Ancients, a race of wise men who ruled the land with
the aid of powerful magic, constructed a network of teleportation
gateways to connect distant cities.  As the reach of their magical
portals grew, so grew the reach of their armies and knowledge.  At
their height the rule of the Ancients extended to every corner of
the known world, and beyond.

With the passing of the Ancients, the system of gates fell into
disuse and decay, and now retains only a hint of its former majesty.
Gatecraft, once practiced by the most common among the Ancients, has
since been forgotten by nearly all men.

The school of Gatecraft retains the only knowledge of the use of
these mystical portals.  Because knowledge of Gates can be a powerful
tool or weapon, Gatecraft spells are jealously guarded even within
the school.  Some aspects of Gatecraft, such as the secret of their
construction, have been completely lost.

Necromancy [900]
----------------
The way of the necromancer leads to fresh graves, the pits of Hades,
and unspeakable horrors found only in dark corners of men's souls.

Power is gained through animation and enslavement of the dead, both
followers as well as nobles.  A necromancer looks upon a bloody
battlefield strewn with the dead as a potential army waiting to be
trained.

Advanced necromancers wield fierce powers, manipulating evil Runes
to effect their will upon the world, and making pacts with demons
to obtain power in return for souls.

With great power also comes great danger, and necromancy is the most
dangerous of the magical arts.  Only those willing to risk death at
the hands of civilized men, or worse fates meted out by demons sent
from the underworld, should even consider its study.

The following skills may be studied directly once Necromancy is known:

Sailing [601]
-------------
Usage:  USE 601 <direction or location>
Or:     SAIL <direction or location>

Requires:  character must be ship's captain
Time:      varies with route taken

Pilot a ship in the given direction, or to the specified
location.  If a location is specified, there must be a direct
route to it from the current location of the ship.

Compass points may be abbreviated:  N, S, E, W.

The character issuing the Pilot ship order must occupy the
first position inside the ship (the character must be the
captain of the ship).

The captain must have a crew to assist in the handling of the
ship.  Galleys require fourteen sailors as oarsmen to row the ship.
Roundships require at least eight sailors to man the ship's rigging.

        ship            crew
        ----            ----
        galley          14 sailors
        roundship       8 sailors

If the required number of crew are not available, travel is still
possible, but will take an extra day for each hand the crew is short.

For example, a galley with only 10 men at the oars will take four
extra days to travel across an ocean route.  A roundship with no
sailors at all would take eight extra days to traverse a route.

Galleys perform equally well regardless of wind conditions.
Roundships may be becalmed and unable to travel.  In the presence
of favorable wind they will travel across ocean routes in half
the rated time.

Overloaded ships do not sail well.  They may take longer than
expected to travel across routes, and are almost certain to
capsize and sink in a storm.  Captains should be careful not
to leave port in a vessel carrying too much cargo.

For convenience, one may use the SAIL order rather than "USE 601".
Knowledge of Pilot ship [601] is still required, however.


Shipbuilding [602]
------------------
Usage:     BUILD galley "Name of ship"
or         BUILD roundship "Name of ship"

Requires:  at least three workers [11]
	   50 wood [77] for a galley, 100 wood for a roundship

Time:      250 worker-days for a galley, 500 for a roundship

To begin construction of a ship, the shipbuilder should unstack from
beneath other characters and issue one of the BUILD orders.  One-fifth
of the lumber is required to start construction.  The rest is deducted
as progress on the ship is made (the second fifth at 20% completion,
the third fifth at 40% completion, etc.)

The shipbuilder and his workers will be placed inside the new ship.

As soon as the required number of worker-days has been invested in
construction, the ship will be christened and declared seaworthy.

To resume construction of a partially completed ship, first enter the
ship, then issue the either "build galley" or "build roundship".

Ships may only be built in locations with a passable route to an
ocean, such as a port city.


Fishing [603]
-------------
Usage:     FISH [number of fish] [days]
Requires:  at least one sailor

Unit must be on a ship on the ocean in order to fish.  Each day
spent fishing there is a 50% chance that the ship will come across
a school of fish.  If fish are found, each sailor will produce one
fish that day.  Provinces generate 50 fish per month which may be
obtained by fishing.

Examples:

    fish         # obtain as many fish as possible
    fish 25      # stop after getting 25 fish
    fish 0 5     # fish for five days
    fish 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 fish, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, fishing will cease as soon as the stocks in the ocean
province have been exhausted.


Survive fatal wound [611]
-------------------------
Usage:   implicit

Knowledge of 611 confers the ability for a noble to survive
a wound which would be normally be fatal.  If the noble's
health reaches zero, either through combat or by other harm,
instead of dying the noble will be restored to full health.

Once the skill has been used, it is forgotten.  To survive
a second fatal would, the noble would have to spend another
Noble Point and study for three weeks to learn 611 again.


Fight to the death [612]
------------------------
Usage:   USE 612 <0|1>
Time:    0 days

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  Knowledge of 612 allows a leader to override
this default break point and set it to 100% instead.

    Break at 50% losses:   USE 612 1  (default)
    Fight to the death:    USE 612 0

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for 612 is checked.
612 works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.


Construct catapult [613]
------------------------
Usage:  USE 613

Requires:  three wood [77]
           three workers [11]

Produces:  one catapult [61]

Time:      fourteen days

The engineer directs the construction of a wheeled wooden frame
containing a mechanism to supply stress to the end of a long
wooden pole.  The pole contains a basket which may be loaded
with stones or other missiles to be hurled against the enemy's
walls, or over them.  A winch to lower the pole and a release
mechanism finish the siege engine.

Catapults are sometimes loaded with the bodies of the enemy's
dead and hurled over their walls, to dishearten the besieged and
spread disease amongst them.


Defense [614]
-------------
Usage:  USE 614

Time:   seven days

The noble will spend time and effort practicing skills and
techniques of personal and combat defense.  Each use of 614
raises the noble's defense rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the
time the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and
will gain 10 points.


Archery [615]
-------------
Usage:  USE 615
Time:   seven days

Learning 615 gives the noble a +50 missile attack rating.

Each seven-day use raises the noble's missile rating by
3-5 points if his starting level is less than 100, and 1-3
points thereafter.  5% of the time the noble will have an
exceptionally good study period and will gain 10 points.

Knowledge of Archery also allows the noble to train archers and
elite archers, via the TRAIN order.


Swordplay [616]
---------------
Usage:  USE 616
Time:   seven days

Use of 616 will cause the noble to spend time and effort practicing
swordplay, for use in personal combat.  Each seven-day use of 616
raises the noble's attack rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the time
the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and will
gain 10 points.

Knowledge of Swordplay also allows the noble to train swordsmen,
knights, and elite guards, via the TRAIN order.




Weaponsmithing [617]
--------------------
Usage:  MAKE  <item> <days>
Time:   as given

Weapons and armor are required for the training of some kinds of
fighters.  Archers require longbows, for instance, elite guard
require plate armor, etc.

Weapons and armor are made with the MAKE command.  The following
weapons and armor may be produced:

    num   item           material
    ---   ----           --------
     72   longbow        yew [68]
     73   plate armor    iron [79]
     74   longsword      iron [79]
     75   pike           wood [77]
     85   crossbow       wood [77]

One unit of the input material may turned into one of the desired
items each day.  For example, MAKE 72 2 would spend two days turning
two yew [68] into two longbows [72].

See the MAKE command for further information.


Petty thievery [631]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 631
Time:   seven days

The skill of the common burglar, 631 allows a thief to work a
city for gold.  The thief may pick pockets, steal from merchants
in the market, enter homes in search of loot, or deceive townsfolk
into parting with their gold with confidence games.

631 may only be used in a city, where there are many opportunities
for the petty thief.  Since reports of thievery tend to make the
city residents tense and alert, 631 may only be used once per month
in each city.

A thief will earn between 50 and 150 gold for each successful use of
631.  There is a 5% chance that instead of obtaining gold, the thief
will be caught and beaten, and receive a 5-15 point health loss.

The amount of gold the thief obtains from the city is deducted from
the city's tax base for the month.

Cities which have recently been pillaged offer no opportunities for
petty thievery, as the residents have already been stripped of their
valuables, and are wary of strangers.


Determine inventory of character [632]
--------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 632 <character>
Time:   seven days

Sneakily learn the contents of the specified character's inventory.
The spy must be in the same location as the target.


Determine skills of character [633]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 633 <character>
Time:   seven days

Sneakily learn what skills the specified character possesses by
crafty observation and spying.

The spy must be in the same location as the target.


Determine character's lord [634]
--------------------------------
Usage:  USE 634 <character>
Time:   seven days

Reveals what player the specified character is sworn to, unless
the target character is concealing its identity.  The spy must be
in the same location as the target.


Conceal faction [635]
---------------------
Usage:  automatic when necessary

Knowledge of 635 causes a character to keep its faction affiliation
secret.  Other units attempting to learn the what player the unit
belongs with the skill Determine character's lord [9521] will fail.

Permissions set for the player of a character concealing its faction
affiliation will not include the character.  For example, suppose
unit [5499] is concealing the fact that it belongs to player [613].
Permissions declared for player [613] (such as ADMIT, DEFEND, etc.)
will not include the sneaky unit [5499], since [5499] will not admit
to an affiliation with [613].

Furthermore, such units will not DEFEND units from their own faction
by default, since this might reveal their identity.


Learn of richest nearby noble [636]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 636
Time:   seven days

Must be used in an inn.  The character will chat with the local
patrons of the inn, inquiring as to the recent comings and goings
of other nearby characters, paying special attention to clues
which would indicate the presence of wealthy units.

Use of 636 will reveal the identity of the richest noble within
three provinces of the inn.  Any character with less than 500
gold is not considered wealthy, and is ignored by 636.


Torture prisoner [637]
----------------------
Usage:  TORTURE <prisoner>
Time:   seven days

Torture is the practice of inflicting pain on a captive prisoner in
order to extract information against the victim's will.

Torture will attempt to learn what faction the prisoner belongs to.
Each torture attempt inflicts a 50 point health loss on the prisoner.

The chance of success depends on the prisoner's loyalty:

	loyalty		chance
	-------		------
	oath-2		  0%
	oath-1		 10%
	contract	 50%
	fear		100%


Sneak into structure [639]
--------------------------
Usage:  SNEAK [building or ship]
Time:   three days

The character will sneak into the specified building or ship.
Once inside, other occupants of the structure will see the
character in their location reports, unless the unit employs
additional methods of concealment.  Occupants will not see the
character enter, however.

To exit the structure by the same means, use SNEAK with no
arguments.

The unit must be alone in order to sneak into and out of buildings
or ships.  It may not be stacked with any other characters, or
possess any followers, such as peasants, soldiers, workers, etc.


Conceal self [641]
------------------
Usage:  USE 641 <flag>
Time:   three days

This skill allows a character to conceal itself from view.
When activiated, other characters will not see the unit in their
location reports, and will not see the unit come and go.

The unit must be alone in order to conceal itself.  It may not be
stacked with any other characters, or possess any followers, such
as peasants, soldiers, workers, etc.  It may also not be the first
character inside a sublocation, building or ship.  The owners of
these small locations are always visible.

Hiding takes three days to accomplish.  However, turning off
concealment takes zero time.

Use of the skill will set whether or not the unit is trying to
hide from view:

	use 641 1	# Hide from view, takes three days
	use 641 0	# Don't conceal self from view, zero days

Note that attempts to gain entrance to buildings or ships with
the MOVE order will subject to the unit to the ADMIT system.
A failure to gain entrance with MOVE will give the unit away to
the structure's owner.


Bird spy [651]
--------------
Usage:  USE 651 <direction or destination>
Time:   three days

The beastmaster employs the use of a bird to fly into an nearby
location and return with a report.  A direction may be given, as
with the MOVE order, or a destination may be specified.  The
destination may be any sublocation in the same province, or
any neighboring location.

For example, a bird could fly from inside a castle in a province to
spy on a tower in a city in the same province.  The bird could spy
on a neighboring province, but not enter sublocations in the
neighboring province.


Capture beasts in battle [652]
------------------------------
Usage:  automatic when needed

Wild animals will ordinarily fight to the death.  Nobles who enter
combat with these creatures must either kill them, or be killed
themselves.

Beastmasters with knowledge of 652, however, can capture rather
than kill these wild animals.  The skilled beastmaster will lure
the animal into a trap, or carefully engage it until the beast
becomes exhausted.  If a group of many beasts is attacked, most
beasts will die during battle, leaving a few (or sometimes none)
for the beastmaster to capture.

652 is used automatically whenever the character attacks (or is
attacked by) one of the following wild beasts:

    nazgul [55]
    centaur [271]
    minotaur [272]
    giant spider [278]
    rat [279]
    lion [280]
    giant bird [281]
    giant lizard [282]
    chimera [284]
    harpie [285]
    dragon [286]
    gorgon [288]
    wolf [289]

To capture wild beasts, the noble should ATTACK them.  A regular
combat will occur, and the noble's stack may suffer casualties.
652 does not change the progress of battle, or the outcome if
the noble loses.

If the noble is victorious, however, instead of the wild beasts
being destroyed, their unit wrapper will be disbanded, and the
beast items will be added to the noble's inventory.

The beastmaster need not be the stack leader for 652 to work.
However, the stack leader will always receive the booty.

For example:  suppose Osswid is stacked over Feasel, and Feasel
knows 652, but Osswid doesn't.  Beasts will be captured in
battle, but they will go into Osswid's inventory, not Feasel's.


Use beasts in battle [653]
--------------------------
Usage:  automatic when needed

This skill grants the beastmaster the ability to control animals
in battle.  Any wild animals in the possession of the beastmaster
will be treated as additional fighters.

For example, a character with 10 soldiers [12] and one lion [280]
who did not know 653 would only use the soldiers in battle.
However, a beastmaster with knowledge of 653 would also employ
the lion in combat.

Only the beasts directly possessed by the beastmaster will aid
combat.  Animals owned by units which do not possess knowledge
of 653 will not be used in battle.

The following animals may be used in combat:

    nazgul [55]          (80,80,0)
    centaur [271]        (30,30,0)
    minotaur [272]       (30,5,0)
    giant spider [278]   (150,100,0)
    rat [279]            (3,3,0)
    lion [280]           (100,100,0)
    giant bird [281]     (200,150,0)
    giant lizard [282]   (45,45,0)
    chimera [284]        (130,130,0)
    harpie [285]         (80,120,0)
    dragon [286]         (500,500,250)
    gorgon [288]         (10,20,0)
    wolf [289]           (5,5,0)
    hound [295]          (1,1,0)


Breed beasts [654]
------------------
Usage:  BREED <item> <item>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to breed two animals together to produce an offspring.
Not all animals produce successful offspring.  Occasionally,
cross-breeding different beasts will produce strange results.

For example:

	To breed two wild horses together:

		BREED 51 51

	To attempt a cross-breed of a horse and an ox:

		BREED 51 76

Because some animals are often unpredictable and violent, there
is a 20% chance that one of the breeding parents will be killed
in the attempt.

The time necessary for the BREED command to function is
dependent on the type of animal produced:
 
     beast                   days
     -----                   ----
     dragon [286]             45
     giant bird [281]         28
     giant spider [278]       21
     chimera [284]            21
     nazgul [55]              14
     lion [280]               14
     harpie [285]             14
     all other beasts          7

Wild horses [51], riding horses [52] and warmounts [53] may be used
interchangably with BREED.


Catch wild horses [655]
-----------------------
Usage:  CATCH  [number of horses]  [days]
Time:   as given or necessary

Attempt to catch any wild horses found roaming the plains or pastures.
Each day the noble will have a 50% chance of catching a wild horse,
if any can be found.  Up to five horses may be caught per month in a
plains province or a pasture.

A unit must know the Catch wild horses [9517] subskill of
Beastmastery [123] in order to catch horses.

Examples:

    catch        # catch as many horses as possible
    catch 1      # stop after catching 1 wild horse
    catch 0 10   # try to catch horses for 10 days
    catch 1 10   # stop after catching 1 wild horse, or 10 days, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, horse-catching ceases when no more horses can be found
roaming in the location.


Train wild horse to riding horse [656]
--------------------------------------
Usage:     MAKE 52

Requires:  one wild horse [51]
Produces:  one riding horse [52]

Time:      three days

Wild horses are first broken to saddle, then trained to respect
and obey whatever riders they may serve.  Once broken, riding
horses become too timid and docile to be of any use in battle.


Train wild horse to warmount [657]
----------------------------------
Usage:     MAKE 53

Requires:  one wild horse [51]
Produces:  one warmount [53]

Time:      seven days

Unlike riding horses, war horses must not be broken.  The war horse
should be trained without destroying any of its spirit.  A warmount
is also be taught much more than a simple riding animal, as it
must know how to defend itself and its rider and to remain calm
in the most frightening situations.


Summon wild men [658]
---------------------
Usage:  USE 658
        MAKE 98 1
Time:   one day

Wild men, or savages, inhabit remote parts of the world.  Savages
communicate by beating their drums to indicate calls-to-arms,
battle challenges, or victory celebrations.

Use of 658 will attempt to summon wild men with drumbeats, and
persuade them to stack with the noble.  Savages will remain with
the noble for 3 months, during which time they will participate
in any battles the noble fights.

To summon wild men, the noble must first use the MAKE 98 1 order
to produce a drum [98].  A drum requires 1 mallorn wood [70] to
produce.  MAKE 98 1 requires knowledge of 658.

The drum may be used to summon wild men with the USE 658 order.
The noble should be in a remote province, preferably surrounded by
areas uninhabited by other characters.  The noble should allow time
for the savage men to hear and follow the drumbeats.  Any wild men
summoned to the province will stack with the noble.

For example:

	make 98 1	# make a drum
	use 658	# use the drum to summon the savages
	wait time 15	# give savages time to arrive and
			# stack with us

The number of savage units in the world is limited.  If all of the
available savages have already been summoned, none will come when
the drum is used.


Persuade wild men to remain [659]
---------------------------------
Usage:  USE 659 <savage>
Time:   seven days

Usage of 659 will induce a group of wild men to remain stacked with
the noble that summoned them.  An application of 659 will add two
months to the duration the wild men will stay with the noble, to a
maximum of four months.

The savage unit to be persuaded to remain must be specified as an
argument to USE 659.


Breed hound [661]
-----------------
Usage:  USE 661
Time:   28 days

Breed and train for service one hound [295].

There is a 50% chance that a given hound will bark
if any stealth characters enter the same location as
the character containing the hound.  Hounds also have
a 50% chance of barking once per month (on a random day)
if any stealth characters are present in the current
location.

Hounds halve the chance that prisoners will escape from the
stack, and will bark each time an escape attempt is foiled.


Bribe noble [671]
-----------------
Usage:   BRIBE <target> <gold> [flag]
Time:    seven days

Offer a character gold in an attempt to win their service.  The
amount must be at least 250 gold, or the receiving noble will not
consider it a serious offer.

Nobles with oathbound loyalty ignore bribes.  They may accept the
gift, but they will not renounce loyalty to their lord.

Nobles with contract loyalty will consider the bribe if it meets
or exceeds their current loyalty rating.  For example, a noble of
loyalty contract-750 would ignore any bribe of less than 750 gold.

Nobles with fear loyalty, or nobles not sworn to any lord, will
seriously consider any bribe of at least 250 gold.

If the receiving noble considers the bribe, there is a 33% chance
they will renounce loyalty to their current lord, and swear fealty
to the bribing character.  There is also a chance that they will
report the bribe or pocket it for themselves.  In some cases they
may even renounce loyalty to their lord, but not swear fealty to
the briber, instead choosing to go off on their own.

Characters who are successfully bribed will have loyalty contract-250
to the bribing character.  If flag is 1, and the bribe attempt is
successful, the bribed character will stack with the briber.

Bribes will be refused by characters who have already switched
lords during the month because of bribery.  For example, suppose
Osswid successfully bribes Feasel, and Feasel swears loyalty to
Osswid.  Later that turn, if Procrustes attempts to bribe Feasel,
Feasel will refuse to accept the bribe.

The bribing character will lose the number of NPs which have
been invested in the bribed character if the bribe is successful.
The previous owner of a bribed noble will have the invested NPs
returned.

Examples:

    bribe 5499 750	# Offer [5499] 750 gold to switch factions.
			# If successful, [5499] will not stack with the
			# briber.

    bribe 3409 300 1	# Offer [3409] 300 gold to switch factions.
			# If successful, [3409] will stack with the briber.



Persuade oathbound noble [672]
------------------------------
Usage:   USE 672 <target> [flag]
Time:    seven days

Attempt to persuade an oathbound noble to defect.  There is
only a chance of success when used on oath-1 nobles.  Oath-2
nobles will not leave their lord under any circumstances.

672 costs 25 gold per use, to pay for gifts, fine meals, handsome
clothing, and other props useful in the persuasion attempt.

Each seven day use yields a 2% chance of success.

If flag is 1, and the persuasion attempt is successful, the target
character will stack with the persuading character.

In order to assume control over a new noble, the persuader
must pay the number of NPs which have been invested in the
desired character.  The previous owner will receive these
NPs when ownership of the character is lost.


Raise peasant mob [673]
-----------------------

Usage:  RAISE
Time:   seven days

The noble gives an impassioned speech, rousing peasants and causing
them to gather into a crowd.  New peasant crowds will set their GUARD
flag to protect their homes from pillaging.

Peasant mobs may be formed in provinces and cities.  Only one crowd
may be raised per location.  Only when the raised mob is later killed,
or if the peasants return to their homes, may another mob be raised
there.


Rally peasant mob [674]
-----------------------
Usage:  RALLY <mob>
Time:   seven days

Deliver a fiery speech to an existing crowd of peasants, causing them
to stack with the noble.  They will remain with the noble for three
months.  The mob must be specified as an argument to RALLY.

Use of 674 on a mob already stacked with the noble will renew the
peasants' enthusiasm, and add an additional three months to the time
they will remain stacked, to a maximum of five months.

Mobs stacked with the noble may not be given any orders, but will
participate in any combat the noble encounters.


Incite mob violence [675]
-------------------------

Usage:  INCITE <mob> <target>
Time:   seven days

Speak out against the target in such as a way as to inspire
public hatred and ire.  The target will be made to seem a
malicious influence responsibile for all of the common man's
troubles.

An existing crowd of peasants must be specified as the first
argument, and the target of their violence as the second.
The mob may not already be stacked under another noble who
has rallied it.

There is a 50% chance that the mob will be roused to attack
the target.

There is also a 33% chance that patrons in any local inns will
learn that the noble is trying to incite a mob to violence
against the target.


Train angry peasants [676]
--------------------------

Usage:  TRAIN 23 [days]
        TRAIN 10 [days]
Time:   as given

The noble employs persuasive means to rouse mild-tempered peasants
into a state of anger.  Angry peasants fight with twice the attack
value of regular peasants.  However, in their excited state they
are untrainable to any other kind of man.

Examples:

	train 23	# train all peasants to angry peasants
	train 23 5	# train five peasants into angry peasants
	train 10	# calm all angry peasants back into peasants

Angry peasants require a monthly maintenance cost of 2 gold each.


Construct siege tower [681]
---------------------------
Usage:  USE 681

Requires:  three wood [77]
           three leather [80]
           three workers [11]

Produces:  one seige tower [62]

Time:      fourteen days

The engineer directs three workers to build a wooden tower,
covered with treated leather skins or iron plating to protect
the tower from burning.  The tower contains several ladders
and a platform from which soldiers may attack.

In battle, the tower is wheeled up against an enemy's walls
and used by attacking soldiers to match the height of the
defenders.  The attackers may then climb from the tower onto
the walls.


Stone quarrying [682]
---------------------
Usage:     QUARRY [number of stones] [days]
Requires:  at least one worker

Building stone is used in the construction of temples, castles and
towers.  Up to 50 stone may be removed from mountain provinces or
rocky hills each month, or up to ten stone from desert provinces.

Each worker will cut and prepare one building stone [78] per day.

Examples:

    quarry         # cut as much building stone as possible
    quarry 25      # stop after cutting 25 stone
    quarry 0 5     # quarry stone for five days
    quarry 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 stone, whichever
                   # comes first

In all cases, quarrying will cease as soon as the supply of ready stone
in the province has been exhausted.


Extract venom from ratspider [691]
----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 691

Required:  one ratspider [81]
Produces:  one ratspider venom [63]
Time:      seven days

The alchemist performs a delicate operation to extract the
highly poisonous ratspider venom.

The top of the ratspider's head is removed by inserting a sharp
knife above the head joint and twisting.  Two glands, from which
the ratspider venom is later extracted, are removed from behind
the mandible.

Risk is minimized by taking extreme care when handling the
ratspider.  The ratspider is killed in the process.

the noble who drinks it will die.

The rare and highly poisonous ratspider venom is used in the
preparation of this potion.  Upon completion, the new potion
will be added to the alchemist's inventory.  The potion will,
of course, be unlabeled.

A character wishing to drink the potion should specify it
to the USE order.  For instance, to drink potion [601], issue
the order:  USE 601.

The creator of a potion must have the necessary NPs to assume

--------------------------
Usage:    MALLORN [number] [days]
Time:     as given or necessary

Mallorn groves produce two units of mallorn wood [70] which may be
harvested each month.

Because of the careful selection required, and the small quantity of
mallorn which becomes ready to cut each month, a noble works at this
task alone.  No workers are needed for mallorn wood cutting.

Each day spent using MALLORN gives a 20% chance of obtaining one
unit of mallorn wood [70].

Examples:

    mallorn         # obtain as much mallorn wood as possible
    mallorn 2       # stop after getting 2 mallorn wood
    mallorn 0 5     # cut mallorn wood for five days
    mallorn 2 5     # stop after five days, or 2 mallorn wood, whichever

    opium 25 5     # stop after five days, or 25 opium, whichever
                   # comes first

In all cases, opium harvesting will cease as soon as the field's supply
for the month has been exhausted.

OPIUM is an alias for COLLECT 93.


Improve opium production [707]
------------------------------
Usage:    USE 707
Time:     seven days

Use of 707 causes the noble to pay special attention to the
development of a poppy field.  Through appropriate fertilization
and agressive weed and pest control, the opium production of the
poppy field will be doubled in the following month, from 25 to 50
units of opium.


Mine iron [721]
---------------
Usage:  USE 721

Requires:  ten workers
Time:      7 days

Iron is widely used in the making of weapons and armor.  It
is a required component of many of the weaponsmithing skill
uses, and is also used for applying a metal tip to galley
rams and battering rams.  An iron roof provides a protective
cover for siege towers.

The character must be in a mine shaft to USE 721.  The mine's
monthly yield of iron will be obtained.  Once mined, no further
iron can be mined until the next month.

Use of this skill will cause the mine shaft to become one-third
of a level deeper.

The quantity of iron obtained will vary with the depth of the
shaft.  The largest deposits of iron are usually found in
shallow mines.


Mine gold [722]
---------------
Usage:  USE 722

Requires:  ten workers
Time:      7 days

Gold is widely accepted as a currency in Olympia.  Its
scarcity lends gold a high value, but it is not so rare
that it cannot be used in the everyday exchange of goods.
It has a high value, but weighs little, and thus is easy to
carry.  Gold is also readily assayable to guarantee its value.

The character must be in a mine shaft to USE 722.  The mine's
monthly yield of gold will be obtained.  Once mined, no further
gold can be mined until the next month.

Use of this skill will cause the mine shaft to become one-third
of a level deeper.

The quantity of gold obtained will vary with the depth of the
shaft.


Mine mithril [723]
------------------
Usage:  USE 723

Requires:  ten workers
Time:      7 days

Mithril is a magical metal used in the by the ancient
elf-lords to construct their bright, fearsome weapons.
Today mithril is the component of some rare construction
skills.

The character must be in a mine shaft to USE 723.  The mine's
monthly yield of mithril will be obtained.  Once mined, no
further mithril can be mined until the next month.

Use of this skill will cause the mine shaft to become one-third
of a level deeper.

The quantity of mithril obtained will vary with the depth of the
shaft.  Mithril is usually found only in very deep mines.  As
the dangers of poison gasses or collapse of the mine shaft increase
with depth, mithril mining tends to be risky.


Conceal identity of trader [731]
--------------------------------
Usage:  BUY  <item> <qty> <price> <have-left> 1
        SELL <item> <qty> <price> <have-left> 1

This skill allows a trader to conceal his identity when
dealing with a market.  By working through middlemen and
employing shady contacts, the trader will not reveal his
identity to the other party to his transaction, or to the
market at large.

To use this skill, the trader should supply a "1" flag as
the fifth argument to the BUY or SELL command.  Note that
The first four arguments must be specified; use "0" for
have-left if it is to be left as the default.

For example, to conceal one's identity when selling 10
pots for 2 gold each, issue the order:

	sell 95 10 2 0 1

If the conceal trade flag is supplied, but the character
does not know 731, the BUY or SELL order will fail.


Find tradegood for sale [732]
-----------------------------
Usage:  USE 732
Time:   21 days

Use of 732 searches for a seller of a new rare
tradegood in the city market.  At the completion of use,
a new tradegood will be created and offered for sale by
the city.

Up to two tradegoods may be sold by each market.
Use of 732 will fail if there are already two rare
tradegoods for sale in the city.

The tradegood will remain for sale in the city for
24-36 months following its addition to the trade list.
At the end of this period it will be removed and no
longer offered for sale (lowering the count of tradegoods
sold in the city by 1).

732 must be used in a city in part of the regular world
(not Hades, Faery, the Cloudlands, or Subworld.)

Markets for rare tradegoods created with 732 may be
found via the skill Find market for tradegood [733].


Find market for tradegood [733]
-------------------------------
Usage:  USE 733 <tradegood>
Time:   14 days

Use of 733 will attempt to find a buyer for a rare
tradegood in the local city market.  The trader must
possess at least one of the tradegood that a buyer
is being sought for.

Markets to purchase rare tradegoods must be at least
8 provinces away from the market selling the rare
tradegood.  A city will purchase at most two rare
tradegoods.  For a given tradegood, there is a 50%
chance that a city will purchase it.

If successful, the city market will begin buying the
rare tradegood.  A trader can hope to earn 2000-3000
gold in profit if a full quantity of the tradegood
is transported between the originating and consuming
cities and sold.

When the tradegood ceases to be sold in the originating
city, the purchasing city will also remove the item from
its purchase list, thus making room for another tradegood
to be bought.

733 must be used in a city in part of the regular world
(not Hades, Faery, the Cloudlands, or Subworld.)


Receive vision [751]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 751 <target>
Time:   ten days

character may only see a vision for a particular target once.

Visions will fail if the target is in a different world than
the priest, i.e. if the priest is in the normal world, but
the target is in Faery or Hades.

Each attempt to receive a vision has a 50% chance of success.


Resurrect dead noble [752]
--------------------------
Usage:  USE 752 <body>
Time:   ten days

Resurrect dead noble [752] must be performed by a priest
in a temple.  The priest must be holding the body of the
dead noble.  There is a 50% chance of success for each
attempt.

If successful, the priest will be charged 1 NP for the
resurrection.  The character will be restored to full
health in the priest's location, and be under the
command of the original owner.

The defense rating of the resurrected noble will be
lowered by 25 points.  If the noble would have a new
defense rating lower than 1, resurrection is not
possible.


Preparatory ritual [753]
------------------------
Usage:  USE 753
Time:   three days

The priest completes a holy ritual which assures future religious
acts of success.  Many skills within the Religion category have a
50% chance of failure; completing 753 before use of these skills
removes the possibility of their failure.


Lay to rest [754]
-----------------
Usage:  USE 754 <dead noble>
Time:   ten days

Use of 754 will commend a dead noble's body to its final resting
place.  The priest must possess the body of the deceased, and
perform 754 in a graveyard.  Upon completion, the dead body will
be consumed, and the NPs invested in the deceased character will
be returned to the original owner.


Remove blessing from soldiers [755]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 755 <target>
Time:   ten days

Remove the blessing from all of the target's blessed soldiers.
Any blessed soldiers possessed by the target will be converted
back to regular soldiers.

If a target is not specified, the target will default to the priest.
The target must be present in the priest's location.

This prayer has a 50% chance of success.


Immunity from Vision [756]
--------------------------
Usage:  USE 756 [target]
Time:   ten days

Immunity from Vision allows a character to prevent scrys
from the Receive Vision [751] skill, and when they
succeed, to detect the identity of the visioning priest.

Each use of [756] increases the vision defense count
of the target character by one point.  If a target is
not specified, [756] works on the priest himself.

A vision attempt by a priest will fail if the count is 1
or higher, and decrease the count by one.  If the count
is zero, a vision by another priest against the
character will succeed.

Characters with Immunity from Vision [756] will be
notified of vision attempts against them, and will
learn the identity of the visioning priest.

Vision defense point are only deceased in response to
a vision attempt from another priest.  The current
vision defense level will be listed in the character's
turn report.

-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 802 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.
This skill allows the magician to perform trivial or common tasks for
the local population of a city or province to earn gold.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love
potions, dowsing for water, or performing conjuring tricks.

This skill earns 10 gold per day for the mage, while work at common
tasks is available.  Cities and provinces support 5 days of work at
common tasks for each point of civilization level.  For example, a
civ-2 city will allow a mage to work for 10 days at common tasks,
earning 100 gold.

If multiple mages work the same location, they compete for the
available work.  Two mages who each began using 802 on the first
day of the month in a civ-2 province would each work for five days,
and each would earn 50 gold.  See the COLLECT order for more details
regarding competition for resources.


Appear common [803]
-------------------
Usage:  USE 803 <aura>

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The caster expends aura to conceal the fact that he is a magician.

          5-10          mage
         11-16          wizard
          17+           sorcerer

Use of 803 allows the tag to be suppressed for a number of turns
equal to the amount of aura invested in the cast.

Uses of 803 are addititive.  A mage with 4 turns of concealment
remaining who ordered "use 803 3" would have a total of seven turns

If a mage is employing an ability shroud, the aura invested in USE 804
must exceed the shroud's aura, or that mage's current aura level won't
be shown.

For instance, USE 804 1 will show the current aura for mages that are
not shrouding their abilities.  USE 804 3 will show the current aura

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

The mage will dip into his own health to generate current aura.
The health loss received is equal to five times the amount of
aura generated.

For example, USE 806 10 would generate 10 points of current aura,
and cause the mage to receive a 50 point wound.

--------------------------------
Usage:  USE 809 [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   three days

magicians to scry his abilities.  No USE is required in order for
scry attempts to be detected.  The skill is automatically employed
whenever the mage is the target of an ability scry spell.

USE of the skill will cause the magician to practice scry detection.
Practice should improve the experience rating with this skill over
time, and cause the mage to become more adept at discovering scry

No aura is depleted when a scry is detected.


Dispel ability shroud [812]
---------------------------

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Current aura level will rise by two points or 10% of the mage's
maximum aura level, whichever is higher.  Current aura may rise
above maximum aura by two points with Advanced Meditation.


Hinder meditation [814]
-----------------------
Usage:  USE 814 <target> [aura]

Required aura:  one to three points, as given
Time to cast:   ten days

Clouds the target's mind with disturbing images and incoherent
thoughts.  The target mage will have difficulty achieving the
proper mental state during his next attempt at meditation.

The next meditate spell issued by the target may fail, resulting
in the mage not acquiring a point of current aura. The more aura
invested in 814, the greater the chance the target mage will fail:

	aura	chance of failure
	----	-----------------
	 1	      10%
	 2	      25%
	 3	      50%
	 4	      75%
	 5	      90%

Hinder meditation [814] directed against mages using Advanced
Meditiation [9174] will cause them to only gain half of the
normal aura obtained.

If the target does not meditate, the spell will lose one point
of aura at the end of each month until it has dissipated.  Casts
by multiple mages accumulate on the target, although the spell may
not accumulate more than five points of aura.

For example, if two mages each cast USE 814 501 3, character [501]
will have a 90% chance of failure in his next attempt to meditate.
(One aura point has been wasted, since only five may accumulate on
the target).  At the end of the month, the strength of the 814
spell against [501] will diminish to two points, and [501] will
have a 50% chance of failure during his next meditation.

A mage may cast multiple 814 spells; they accumulate on the targets,
not on the casting magician.

814 has no effect on non-magicians.

The default amount of aura is one point.

For example, "USE 821 <storm> ce90 5" would cause <storm> to spend
five of its remaining aura points against target [ce90], causing
five points of damage.

If aura is not specified, the storm will expend all of its remaining
energy in the attack.  The mage does not need to be in the same
location as the storm.


Bind storm to ship [822]
------------------------
Usage:  BIND <storm>

Required aura:  three or more points
Time to cast:   seven days

Bind an existing storm to a ship.  The caster must be the owner of
the storm (having summoned it himself, or siezed control of it),
and must be on the ship the storm is to be bound to.

Subsequent movement of the ship will cause the storm to follow.
This can be especially useful if a wind storm is bound to a
roundship, as the roundship will enjoy faster travel while the
aura of the wind storm lasts.


Scribe weather symbols [823]
----------------------------
Usage:  USE 823 <spell>

Required aura:  two points
Required item:  blank scroll [84]
Time to cast:   seven or more days

Transcribe the given spell onto a blank scroll.  The blank scroll will
be consumed, and a new unique scroll will be produced.  The scroll will
permit one character to learn the spell from the scroll.

Example:

    USE 823 nnnn       # make a one-time study scroll for spell nnnn

Only Weather magic [820] spells may be scribed with this skill.

The spell must be known by the character in order to be written.
The character will still know the spell after it has been scribed.

This spell requires as much time to cast as the skill takes to learn.
It takes two weeks to write a spell which requires two weeks of study
to learn.


Summon rain [824]
-----------------
Usage:  USE 824 <aura> ["Name of storm"]

Required aura:  three or more points
Time to cast:   seven days

Summon a rain weather entity.  Rain storms may be summoned from
forest or ocean provinces.  Once a location has produced a rain
storm, another rain storm may not be summoned from that place
until the first storm has dissipated.

The storm will have a strength of twice the amount of aura invested
in its summoning.  Storms lose one point of strength at the end of
each month.  When a storm's strength reaches zero, it dissipates.

While the storm exists, the summoner will get a location report
for the storm's province.


Summon wind [825]
-----------------
Usage:  USE 825 <aura> ["Name of storm"]

Required aura:  three or more points
Time to cast:   seven days

Summon a wind weather entity.  Wind may be summoned from plains,
ocean, mountain or desert provinces.  Once a location has produced
a wind entity, another wind may not be summoned from that place
until the first has dissipated.

The wind entity will have a strength of twice the amount of aura
invested in its summoning.  Wind loses one point of strength at
the end of each month.  When a wind entity's strength reaches zero,
it dissipates.

While the wind exists, the summoner will get a location report
the province that it is in.


Summon fog [826]
----------------
Usage:  USE 826 <aura> ["Name of storm"]

Required aura:  three or more points
Time to cast:   seven days

Summon a fog.  Fog may be summoned from forest, swamp and ocean
provinces.  Once a location has produced a fog, another fog may
not be summoned from that place until the first has dissipated.

The fog will have a strength of twice the amount of aura invested
in its summoning.  Storms lose one point of strength at the end of
each month.  When a fog's strength reaches zero, it dissipates.

While the fog exists, the summoner will get a location report for
the province that it is in.

Character sightings will not appear in foggy province's location
report.  Characters in sublocations of the province will still
be seen, however.  Consequently, automatic HOSTILE attacks do not
function in provinces when fog is present.

Also, all sublocations of a foggy province are treated as if they
are hidden.  Thus, if a sublocation is already known to a character,
the character will continue to see the sublocation.  However,
locations which have not been visited by a character will have to
be found with EXPLORE before they can be entered (or until the
fog passes.)


Direct storm [827]
------------------
Usage:  USE 827 <storm> <direction or destination>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   one day

Direct an existing storm which the caster has previously summoned
to move to an adjacent province at the end of the month.  Storms
only move once per month, and may only exist at the province level
(they may not move into sublocations or buildings.)

The caster need not be in the same location as the storm in order
to direct it.

At the end of the month, the storm will move to its new province,
and the mage will receive a report for the storm's new location.


Dissipate storm [828]
---------------------
Usage:  USE 828 <storm>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Dissipate an existing storm.  The storm must be owned by the mage,
and be in the same province as the caster.  One-quarter of the
remaining strength of the storm will be added to the mage's current
aura rating.


Renew storm strength [829]
--------------------------
Usage:  USE 829 <storm> <aura>

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   three days

Invest aura in an existing storm.  The storm must be in the same
province as the caster.  Each point of the mage's aura used will
add two points of aura to the storm's strength.


Lightning bolt [831]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 831 <storm> <target> [aura]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Use a rain storm to deliver a lightning bolt against a target in the
province.  Aura is the amount of storm strength to deliver in the
blast.  If aura is not specified, the storm will expend all of its
remaining engery in the bolt.  The mage does not need to be in the
same location as the storm.

The lightning bolt may be delivered against any building or character
directly in the storm's province.  It will do an amount of damage
equal to the strength of the bolt.


Seize control of storm [832]
----------------------------
Usage:  USE 832 <storm>

Required aura:  five points
Time to cast:   seven days

Seize control of a storm from another mage.  The storm must be in

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Use a fog to kill an enemy target's men.  Only peasants, soldiers,
crossbowmen, workers and sailors are vulnerable to death by fog.
Two of the target's men are killed for each point of the storm's
aura used.  If aura is not given, all of the remaining strength of
the storm will be used.

The caster does not need to be in the same location as the fog to
cast this spell.


Scry location [841]
-------------------
Spell:  Scry location [9141]

Usage:  USE 841 <location> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Grants the mage a vision of the specified place, no matter
how far away he might be.

If the target location is magically shrouded from scry attempts,
sufficient aura must be used for 841 to pierce the shroud.
For example, a location shroud of three aura would require
USE 841 <location> 4 to overcome (costing four aura to cast).

It is not possible to scry a netherworld location (a location in
Hades or Faery) from the real world, or vice-versa.

The default aura to use is one point.


Shroud location from magical scry [842]
---------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 842 [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   three days

Creates a magical shroud over the mage's current province.  The
shroud hinders attempts by distant mages to view the location by
magical scrying.

The shroud is invested with twice the aura used in its creation.
A mage attempting to view the location from a distance with a
scry spell must expend a greater amount of aura than the shroud
possesses to succeed.

The shroud loses one point of aura at the end of each month.
Successive uses of 842 are additive.  For example, USE 842 1
followed by USE 842 3 will result in a location shroud with an
aura of eight points.

The default aura to use is one point.


Dispel location shroud [843]
----------------------------
Usage:  USE 843 <location>

Required aura:  three points
Required item:
Time to cast:   three days

Dispels any magical shroud inhibiting scrying of the specified
location.

------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 844 <spell>

Required aura:  two points
Required item:  blank scroll [84]
Time to cast:   seven or more days

Transcribe the given spell onto a blank scroll.  The blank scroll will
be consumed, and a new unique scroll will be produced.  The scroll will
permit one character to learn the spell from the scroll.

Example:

    USE 844 nnnn       # make a one-time study scroll for spell nnnn

Only Scrying [162] spells may be scribed with this skill.

The spell must be known by the character in order to be written.
The character will still know the spell after it has been scribed.

This spell requires as much time to cast as the skill takes to learn.
It takes two weeks to write a spell which requires two weeks of study
to learn.


Create magical barrier [845]
----------------------------
Spell:  Create magical barrier [9160]

Usage:  USE 845 [aura]

Required aura:  one to eight points
Required item:
Time to cast:   ten days

Erects a magical barrier which prevents anyone from entering the
location.  The barrier will lose one point of aura at the end of
each turn, and will dissipate when it has no aura remaining.

For example, USE 845 1 will create a barrier over the location
which lasts until the end of the turn.  USE 845 2 will create
a barrier which lasts until the end of the next turn.

Multiple casts of 845 are additive.

A barrier which achieves eight points of aura becomes permanent.
Permanent barriers do not decay at the end of each month.  They
may only be removed by a magician.

Aura defaults to one.


Remove magical barrier [846]
----------------------------
Spell:  Remove magical barrier [9161]

Usage:  USE 846 <direction> [aura]

Required aura:  one to four points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Attempt to remove a magical barrier from the location in the
given direction.  If direction "0" is given, a barrier over
the current location will be removed.

The chance that the barrier will be successfully removed is
proportional to the aura invested in the attempt:

	aura	chance of success
	----	-----------------
	 1             10%
	 2             25%
	 3	       50%
	 4	       75%


Locate character [847]
----------------------
Usage:  USE 847 <character> [aura]

Required aura:  one to three points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   ten days

Attempt to locate the specified character.  If successful, the
mage will learn the location in which the character is currently
located.

The more aura expended, the greater the chance that the character
will be located.

	aura	chance of success
	----	-----------------
	 1            50%
	 2            75%
	 3            90%

It is not possible to locate a character in Hades or Faery
if one is in the real world, and vice-versa.


Detect location scry [848]
--------------------------
Usage:  USE 848

Required aura:  one point
Required item:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Knowledge of 848 will inform the mage of attempts made by other
magicians to scry the mage's current location.  No USE is required
in order for scry attempts to be detected.  The skill is used
automatically whenever the mage's location is the target of an
location scry spell.

USE of the skill will cause the magician to practice scry detection.
Practice should improve the experience rating with this skill over
time, and cause the mage to become more adept at discovering scry
attempts and identifying their source.

Aura is only consumed by this spell when it is used for practice.
No aura is depleted when a scry is detected.


Farcasting [849]
----------------
Usage:  USE 849 <location>

Required aura:  distance in provinces to <location>
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

If successful, the location check for the next spell cast
attempted will be made from the given location instead of
the location the mage is in.

The amount of aura consumed is equal to the distance in
provinces from the mage's location to the target location.
For instance, to project a cast into an adjoining province
requires two aura.  To project a cast between any of the
sublocations within a province requires one aura.

The projected cast state will persist until the mage's next use
of magic.  The mage may move before casting the next spell;
movement will not alter the target location for spell projection.

Unless the mage is projecting to the same location he is in,
a magical shroud over the target location will cause this
spell to fail.

Farcasts may not be initiated between Hades, Faery and the real
world.


Save farcast state [851]
------------------------
Usage:  USE 851

Required aura:   three
Required item:
Time to cast:    seven days

The state where a mage's next cast will be projected to a different
location may be saved with this spell.  A potion will be created
which, upon use, will revive the projected cast state.

For example, a mage establishes that his next spell cast will be based
from Drassa [cx59].  He then issues USE 851 to preserve this state.
Magical potion [8764] is created.  He later issues USE 8764 to drink
the potion.  His next spell will be based from Drassa.

The mage will no longer have a projected cast state after use of this
spell.


Banish undead [852]
-------------------
Usage:  USE 852

Required aura:  number of undead in location
Time to cast:   seven days

Banish all undead from the caster's location.  Requires one aura
point for every undead to be banished.  The spell is all-or-none;
if sufficient aura is not available to banish all of the undead at
once, the spell fails, and no undead will be banished.  (No aura
is used if the spell fails, however).


Teleport [861]
--------------
Usage:  USE 861 <location>

Required aura:  one point for each 50 weight
Required item:  gate crystal [83]
Time to cast:   one day

This skill allows a mage to teleport to the given location without
a gate.  A gate crystal is required to fuel the jump.  The gate
crystal is consumed by the jump.

One point of aura is required for each 50 units of weight in the
caster's stack to be transported.

Teleportation between the netherworlds (Hades & Faery) and
the real world is not possible.


Detect gates [862]
------------------
Usage:  USE 862

Required aura:  one point
Required item:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Identify any gates present in the current location.

If there are no gates in the caster's location, Detect gates [862]
will indicate how far away the nearest gate is.


Jump through gate [863]
-----------------------
Usage:  USE 863 <gate> [key]

Required aura:  one point for each 50 weight
Required item:  none
Time to cast:   one day

The caster will teleport through the specified gate.  The gate
must be present in the current location.  If the gate is sealed
with a key, the key must be supplied for the jump to succeed.

One point of aura is required for each 50 units of weight in the
caster's stack to be transported.


Seal gate [864]
---------------
Usage:  USE 864 <gate> <key>

Required aura:  six points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Seal the gate with the given key.  The gate must be present in
the current location, and must not already be sealed.

The key is a numeric password which will be required for further
access to the gate for jumps or other manipulations.  Only those
who supply the key number will be granted access.  The number
should be between 1 and 999.

    For example, if Gate [8192] is sealed with USE 9117 8192 123
    then the key "123" must be supplied as a parameter to the
    jump spell, or the jump will fail.


Unseal gate with key [865]
--------------------------
Usage:  USE 9118 <gate> <key>

Required aura:  three points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days.

Remove the seal from a gate by supplying the key.  The key will
no longer be required for jumps through the gate.

    For example, if Gate [8192] were sealed with key "123",
    the spell USE 865 8192 123 would unseal the gate.
    Jumps through the gate could proceed without supplying
    the key.


Notify if gate unsealed [866]
-----------------------------
Usage:  USE 866 <gate> <key>

Required aura:  five points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Inform the sealer of the gate if the seal is broken, and of the

present in the current location to apply this spell.  However,
notification will occur wherever the caster happens to be.


Forcefully unseal gate [867]
----------------------------
Usage:  USE 867 <gate>

Required aura:  eight points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Forcefully remove a seal from a gate without specifying the key.
The key will no longer be required to perform jumps through the gate.
The gate must be present in the current location.


Reveal gate key [868]
---------------------
Usage:  USE 868 <gate>

Required aura:  ten points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Reveal the numeric key necessary to make use of a sealed gate.
The gate must be present in the current location.


Notify of gate jumps [869]
--------------------------
Usage:  USE 869 <gate>

Required aura:  six points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Notify the caster of the identity of any mages jumping through the
specified gate.  The gate must be present in the current location
to apply this spell.  However, the caster will be notified if the
gate is used, wherever he may be at the time.

Only one [869] spell may be active on a gate at a time.  Casting
this spell on a gate already notifying another mage of jumps will
displace the previous mage's spell.


Language of the Ancients [871]
------------------------------
Usage:  USE 871 <spell>

Required aura:  two points
Required item:  blank scroll [84]
Time to cast:   seven or more days

The Ancients were a race of wise, powerful men who walked the lands
long before the modern inhabitants had arrived.  Their language is
heavy and descriptive, well suited to expressing their detailed and
complex thoughts.

Transcribe the given spell onto a blank scroll.  The blank scroll will
be consumed, and a new unique scroll will be produced.  The scroll will
permit one character to learn the spell from the scroll.

Example:

    USE 871 nnnn       # make a one-time study scroll for spell nnnn

Only Gatecraft [163] spells may be scribed with this skill.

The spell must be known by the character in order to be written.
The character will still know the spell after it has been scribed.

This spell requires as much time to cast as the skill takes to learn.
It takes two weeks to write a spell which requires two weeks of study
to learn.


Reverse jump through gate [872]
-------------------------------
Usage:  USE 872 <gate> [key]

Required aura:  two points for each 250 weight
Required item:  none
Time to cast:   one day

Gates were long thought to be one way portals through space.
Most mages believed that returning to the starting location
required a second gate or a conventional journey.

However, it is possible to jump back to a gate from the gate's
destination.  Reversing the direction of teleportation is
difficult, so the jump requires twice as much aura as a
forward jump.

As with a conventional jump, the mage must know the gate's
entity number as well as the key, if necessary.


Forge auraculum [881]
---------------------
Usage:  USE 881 <aura-level> "Name"

Required aura:   as specified by caster
Required items:  100 gold, 5 mithril
Time to cast:    fourteen days

Forge a magical auraculum, giving it the specified name.

   An auraculum is a magical artifact which concentrates and amplifies
   a mage's power.  A permanent investment of maximum aura is made when
   constructing the auraculum.  The artifact doubles the invested aura.
   However, since a portion of the mage's pneuma has been bound in the
   auraculum, it is important to safeguard it from being lost or stolen.

In addition to depleting the caster's current aura level, the specified
aura amount will be permanently removed from the magician's maximum aura
rating.  The new object, while possessed by its maker, will augment the
mage's maximum aura rating by twice the amount of aura invested in its
creation.

Possession of an auraculum doubles the amount of aura a mage naturally
recovers each month, from two points to four.

Creation of an auraculum also grants knowledge of the Advanced sorcery
magical skill category.  Advanced sorcery may not be learned in any
other way.

Example:

   A mage of current aura level 10, maximum aura 10 who issues
   USE 881 5 "Ring of power" will be reduced to current aura level 5,
   maximum aura level 5.  However, the new artifact will add 10 points
   to the maximum aura rating of its creator, but only while it is in
   his possession.

       Current aura:   10
       Maximum aura:   10

    1: > use 881 5 "Ring of power"
    1: Attempt to forge an auraculum.
       ...
   14: Created Ring of power [js80].
   14: Learned Advanced sorcery [166].

       Current aura:   5
       Maximum aura:   15 (5+10)
 
Characters other than the auraculum's creator do not receive an aura
bonus from possession of the object.

Since the mage has bound a portion of his aura into the artifact, its
destruction would deal him an instant, fatal blow.  Thus, the creator
of such an object should use all means to prevent it from being lost
or stolen.  However, magical items of such power are hard to destroy.
An auraculum may only be destroyed in the province in which it was
created.

This spell may only be used once.  A magician may only create one
auraculum during his lifetime.

The creator of the artifact may change its name later with the
NAME order.  The object must be possessed in order to rename it.

   > name js80 "Wooden staff"
   Ring of power [js80] will now be known as Wooden staff [js80].

--------------------------------
Usage: USE 882 <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points of aura
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Required aura:  one or more points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

---------------------------------------
Usage: USE 885 <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Curse noncreator loyalty [886]
------------------------------
Usage:  USE 886 <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   fourteen days

Curses a forged magical artifact such that possession by any
character other than the creator will cause that character's
loyalty to erode.  The amount of loyalty lost is proportional
to the aura invested with 886.

For example, USE 886 8192 10 would place a ten aura noncreator
curse on artifact [8192].  Anyone except the artifact's creator
would lose ten points of loyalty each turn that they held the
object.

The actual loss of loyalty will occur on a random day during
the month.

Multiple uses of 886 on the same artifact are additive.

Aura defaults to one.

	> created Shield of Achilles [ha53].

	Inventory:
           1  Shield of Achilles [ha53]           0  +25 defense


Forge magical bow [889]

	> created Hand of Legolas [ha53].

	Inventory:
           1  Hand of Legolas [ha53]           0  +25 missile

Destroy artifact [893]
----------------------
Usage:  USE 9164 <artifact>

Required aura:  two points
Required item:  a magical artifact
Time to cast:   seven days

Attempt to destroy a magical artifact.  The artifact must be in the
caster's possession.  Some artifacts can only be destroyed in the
location in which they were created.

Any spells contained in the artifact will be lost when it is destroyed.
Any aura trapped in the artifact will be released into the caster's
current aura rating.


Forge palantir [894]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 894

Required aura:   eight
Required items:  one mithril [82]
                 one gate crystal [83]
Time to cast:    ten days

A palantir, or stone of far-seeing, is a crystal orb used to
view images from a great distance.  Once created, the palantir
may be used to view a distant location:

	use <palantir> <location>

For example, if a USE 894 creates Palantir [6289], then one may
view City of Drassa [cx61] with the palantir by issuing the order:

	use 6289 cx61

Use of the palantir takes seven days.  Any character may use the
palantir; no magical abilities are required.  However, a palantir
may only be used once each turn.


Transcend death [901]
---------------------
Usage:   automatic when needed

Transcend death allows a mortal to pass through Hades unmolested
by the foul and dangerous spirits who live there.  The necromancer
must be alone, however.  He cannot be stacked with any other
nobles, or be accompanied by any followers.

It is also said that when a necromancer with knowledge of 901 dies,
the body vanishes, and the mage is recreated somewhere in Hades,
albeit lacking any of his worldly possessions.


Runes of Evil [902]
-------------------
Usage:  USE 902 <spell>

Required aura:  two points
Required item:  blank scroll [84]
Time to cast:   seven or more days

The most basic and powerful of the magical languages, Runes of Evil
may represent vast power.  Descended from neither man or spirit,
they represent the fundamental Commands which shape the world and
its events.  They may represent concepts which men are incapable of
speaking, or even thinking.

Transcribe the given spell onto a blank scroll.  The blank scroll will
be consumed, and a new unique scroll will be produced.  The scroll will
permit one character to learn the spell from the scroll.

Example:

    USE 902 nnnn       # make a one-time study scroll for spell nnnn

Only Necromancy [165] spells may be scribed with this skill.

The spell must be known by the character in order to be written.
The character will still know the spell after it has been scribed.

This spell requires as much time to cast as the skill takes to learn.
It takes two weeks to write a spell which requires two weeks of study
to learn.


Summon ghost warriors [903]
---------------------------
Usage:  MAKE 18 [days]

Required aura:  one point per day
Time to cast:   as given

Each day of summoning requires one point of aura, and yields two
ghost warriors.

Ghost warriors [18] are spirits of dead soldiers summoned to fight
again on the battlefield.  They have no substance, and thus are
ineffectual attackers.  Opponents will still select them in combat,
however, so they are useful for absorbing enemy hits.

Ghost warriors have a attack and defense values of zero.  One hit
by any attacker will cause them to vanish.

One ghost warrior returns to the Land of the Dead at the end of
each month.


Raise undead [904]
------------------
Usage:   COLLECT 31 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Undead [31] are dead bodies animated with foul magic, summoned
from their graves.  While not particularly swift or strong,
their horrifying nature often inspires terror amongst their
foes on the battlefield.  Thus they fight with combat rating
attack-10, defense-10.

One undead may be summoned per day from a graveyard.
Graveyards furnish up to 15 undead each month.

One or two undead may decompose at the end of each month.


Summon demon lord [905]
-----------------------
Usage:  USE 905 [aura]

Required aura:  three to eight points
Time to cast:   seven days

Summon a demon lord unit from a graveyard.  The demon lord will
appear with 15-25 undead and stack with the summoner.

Each graveyard will support the summoning of one demon lord.  No
further demon lord units may be summoned from a graveyard until
the graveyard's demon lord has been destroyed or banished.

The amount of aura invested in the summoning determines the
strength of the demon lord.  The default aura is three points.

	aura	attack/defense
	----	--------------
	 3	  (100,100)
	 4	  (150,150)
	 5	  (190,190)
	 6	  (220,220)
	 7	  (240,240)
	 8	  (250,250)

Each undead accompanying the demon lord fights with attack-1,
defense-1.

The demon lord's service is secured with a bond which lasts five
months, unless renewed.  Demon lords should be banished or have
their bonds renewed before the five months expires, or they may
exercise their wrath on the summoner.

Other Necromatic spells provide for banishment of demon lords and
renewal of their loyalty bonds.


Renew demon bond [906]
----------------------
Usage:  USE 906 <target>

Required aura:  three points
Time to cast:   seven days

Renew the loyalty bond for a demon lord.  This spell will cause
the demon lord to remain stacked with its summoner for an additional
four months.  Demon lord loyalty bonds accumulate to a maximum of
eight months.

It is wise to keep a demon lord's loyalty bond renewed, lest it
erode completely, and the demon unit turns on its master.


Banish demon lord [907]
-----------------------
Usage:  USE 907 <target>

Required aura:  six points
Time to cast:   seven days

Return an demon lord to the Land of the Dead.  The demon lord
unit must be present in the caster's location.

Once banished, a summoner may again call the demon lord from
his home graveyard.


Eating of the dead [908]
------------------------
Usage:  USE 908 <dead body>

Required aura:  five points
Required item:  ratspider venom
Time to cast:   fourteen days

A complex ritual is executed whereby the mage ingests the ratspider
venom together with the brains of the dead noble.  The mage will
learn every skill previously known by the dead noble.

There is a 25% chance that the toxic venom of the ratspider will cause
the mage to become ill.


Aura blast [909]
----------------
Usage:  USE 909 <target> [aura] [have-left]

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The mage directs a blast of raw energy at the target character.
The target will suffer two points of damage for each point of
aura used in the blast.  For example, USE 909 5201 25 would
send a blast of 25 aura at [5201], causing a 50 point wound.

If aura is zero, all available current aura will be used.  If
have-left is given, at least that much current aura will be
retained, and not used for the blast

It is not possible to aura blast between Hades, Faery and
the real world.


Absorb aura blast [911]
-----------------------
Usage:  USE 911 <flag>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   zero days

Knowledge of 911 will, by default, cause the mage to absorb any
blasts of aura instead of being harmed by them.  If absorbed,
half of the aura used in the blast will be added to the aura
of the mage being blasted.

Instead of absorbing aura, the blast may be reflected back to the
attacker.  To set this option, specify a flag of 1:

	use 911 1	# reflect aura blasts back at attacker
	use 911 0	# absorb aura blasts into current aura

Aura blasts may only be reflected once.  If a blast is reflected back
to an attacker with knowledge of 911, the attacker will be harmed,
and will not absorb or reflect the blast.


Trance [921]
------------
Usage:  TRANCE

Required aura:   none
Time to cast:    28 days

Causes the mage enters a deep trance which lasts nearly an
entire month.  Upon completition, the mage is cured of any
illness or injury.  The mage's current aura rating will be
raised to 2/3 of his maximum effective rating (maximum
aura rating plus bonuses from any items held.)  If the
mage's current aura rating is already higher than 2/3 of
his maximum, the current aura rating will be unchanged.


Teleport items [922]
--------------------
Usage:  USE 922 <to-who> <item> [qty] [have-left]

Required aura:   three points + one per 250 weight
Time to cast:    three days

Teleport quantity of an item in inventory to another character.
Specifying zero for quantity will cause the unit to teleport all
of its inventory of the item.  An amount specified by have-left
will be retained.

For example, if Feasel has 100 gold [1]:

        USE 922 5499 1 50          #  Send 50 gold to [5499]
        USE 922 5499 1 0           #  Send all 100 gold to [5499]
        USE 922 5499 1 100         #  Send all 100 gold to [5499]
        USE 922 5499 1 100 25      #  Send 75 gold to [5499]
        USE 922 5499 1 0 25        #  Send 75 gold to [5499]

Three points of aura are required to teleport items, plus one extra
point of aura for each 250 units of weight to be sent.

Use of 922 is subject to the same permission checks as GIVE.
