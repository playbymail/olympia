Shroud location from magical scry [842]
---------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 842 [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   three days

Creates a magical shroud over the mage's current province.  The
shroud hinders attempts by distant mages to view the location by
magical scrying.

The shroud is invested with twice the aura used in its creation.
A mage attempting to view the location from a distance with a
scry spell must expend a greater amount of aura than the shroud
possesses to succeed.

The shroud loses one point of aura at the end of each month.
Successive uses of 842 are additive.  For example, USE 842 1
followed by USE 842 3 will result in a location shroud with an
aura of eight points.

The default aura to use is one point.


Dispel location shroud [843]
----------------------------
Usage:  USE 843 <location>

Required aura:  three points
Required item:
Time to cast:   three days

Dispels any magical shroud inhibiting scrying of the specified
location.


Ciphered writing of Areth-Pirn [844]
------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 844 <spell>

Required aura:  two points
Required item:  blank scroll [84]
Time to cast:   seven or more days

Transcribe the given spell onto a blank scroll.  The blank scroll will
be consumed, and a new unique scroll will be produced.  The scroll will
permit one character to learn the spell from the scroll.

Example:

    USE 844 nnnn       # make a one-time study scroll for spell nnnn

Only Scrying [840] spells may be scribed with this skill.

The spell must be known by the character in order to be written.
The character will still know the spell after it has been scribed.

This spell requires as much time to cast as the skill takes to learn.
It takes two weeks to write a spell which requires two weeks of study
to learn.


Create magical barrier [845]
----------------------------
Usage:  USE 845 [aura]

Required aura:  one to eight points
Required item:
Time to cast:   ten days

Erects a magical barrier which prevents anyone from entering the
location.  The barrier will lose one point of aura at the end of
each turn, and will dissipate when it has no aura remaining.

For example, USE 845 1 will create a barrier over the location
which lasts until the end of the turn.  USE 845 2 will create
a barrier which lasts until the end of the next turn.

Multiple casts of 845 are additive.

A barrier which achieves eight points of aura becomes permanent.
Permanent barriers do not decay at the end of each month.  They
may only be removed by a magician.

Aura defaults to one.


Farcasting [849]
----------------
Usage:  USE 849 <location>

Required aura:  distance in provinces to <location>
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

If successful, the location check for the next spell cast
attempted will be made from the given location instead of
the location the mage is in.

The amount of aura consumed is equal to the distance in
provinces from the mage's location to the target location.
For instance, to project a cast into an adjoining province
requires two aura.  To project a cast between any of the
sublocations within a province requires one aura.

The projected cast state will persist until the mage's next use
of magic.  The mage may move before casting the next spell;
movement will not alter the target location for spell projection.

Unless the mage is projecting to the same location he is in,
a magical shroud over the target location will cause this
spell to fail.

Farcasts may not be initiated between Hades, Faery and the real
world.
