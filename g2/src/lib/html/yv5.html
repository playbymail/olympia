Weaponsmithing [617]
--------------------
Usage:  MAKE  <item> <days>
Time:   as given

Weapons and armor are required for the training of some kinds of
fighters.  Archers require longbows, for instance, elite guard
require plate armor, etc.

Weapons and armor are made with the MAKE command.  The following
weapons and armor may be produced:

    num   item           material
    ---   ----           --------
     72   longbow        yew [68]
     73   plate armor    iron [79]
     74   longsword      iron [79]
     75   pike           wood [77]
     85   crossbow       wood [77]

One unit of the input material may turned into one of the desired
items each day.  For example, MAKE 72 2 would spend two days turning
two yew [68] into two longbows [72].

See the MAKE command for further information.


Stealth [630]
-------------
Stealth includes the arts of theft, spying, assassination,
kidnapping, and other covert activities.  Most stealth
skills will not make use of soldiers or other followers,
instead relying on the sneakiness of a lone character.

The following skills may be studied directly once Stealth is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   631    Petty thievery                     two weeks
   632    Determine inventory of character   two weeks
   633    Determine skills of character      two weeks
   634    Determine character's lord         two weeks
   635    Conceal faction                    four weeks

Further skills may be found through research.
