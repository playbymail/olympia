Combat
------

Combat in Olympia occurs when one stack attacks another stack.

A unit will be defended by any other characters it is stacked with.

Only the leader of a stack may initiate combat.  If another unit
in a stack wants to issue ATTACK, it must first drop out of the
stack.

Combat involves nobles, who possess strong heroic fighting abilities,
and any fighters who may be accompanying them.  Other men, such as
peasants, workers and sailors, do not participate in battle.


Resolution of battle
--------------------

Each kind of fighter has an attack and defense rating:

                     attack  defense
                    +---------------
    soldier         |   1       1 
    pikeman         |   5       5
    swordsman       |  15      15
    knight          |  45      45
    elite guard     |  90      90
    crossbowman     |  25       1 
    archer          |  50       5 
    elite archer    |  75      10 

When one man attacks another, the chance that the attacker will kill
the defender is proportional to their attack and defense ratings.

    A(attack=90) vs B(defense=45)     A has a 2/3 chance of killing B
    A(attack=90) vs B(defense=90)     A has a 1/2 chance of killing B

During combat, a random man will be picked, choosing from both sides,
and he will attack a randomly selected enemy.  If the attack succeeds,
the enemy will be killed.  This continues until the battle is over.

When one side has sustained 50% losses, that side is declared the
loser.  The winner may then attempt to take prisoners.  The chance
that a given defeated unit will be taken prisoner is proportional
to the sizes of the remaining forces.

(Taking prisoners in battle and claiming loot requires many soldiers
to run after the fleeing enemy.  Thus, the chance of success is based
on numerical advantage rather than combat skill.)

        1:1     25%
        2:1     50%
        3:1     75%

If the winning side outnumbers the defeated force by 2:1, there
is a 50% chance that a given defeated unit will be captured.
Defeated units which are not captured retreat from battle.
If they are occupying a building or are located in a city, they
may flee into the outlying province.

The victor always has at least a 25% chance of taking a unit
prisoner, but no better than a 75% chance.


Nobles in combat
----------------

Nobles have strong innate heroic abilities, and so even an unarmed,
untrained noble is a formidable opponent on the battlefield.

An noble is rated (attack=80, defense=80).

When a noble is wounded, he is taken out of the fight, and suffers a
1-100 loss of health.  Nobles already wounded when they enter combat
therefore run a greater risk of death on the battlefield.  Because
nobles may fall ill as a result of their injuries, even those who
survive may later die from their wounds.

See the section on health for more information on wounds, illness and
healing.





-----------------------
ATTACK <target> [flag]
Time:  2 days
-----------------------

Engage two stacks in combat.  Only the top most character in
a stack may initiate combat.

If flag is 1, the attacker will not attempt to move into the
defender's position.

A unit may not attack another member of its own faction.
Two units in the same stack may not engage in combat.  




Battles take place between stacks, not between individual units.  If a
unit is attacked then the unit's stack is attacked and all units will
aid in the defense.  Offensive and defensive ratings are summed for
every unit in the stack to determine battle outcomes.  Thus stacking
with a fortification will cause the stack to gain any advantages or
disadvantages of the fortification.

It is harder to capture a unit than to kill it.  Attacking for booty
means that the attacker will not pursue a unit that chooses to flee,
but will stop and pick up whatever booty it could collect.  Units
fleeing in terror tend to leave some valuables behind.

Booty gained through combat is not counted against weight limits
for river boats, ocean ships or fortresses for the rest of the
turn in which it is won.

Engage target in combat.





Combat
------

Takes place when one stack attacks another.
Combat will involve the attacking stack, and the entire
	defending stack, plus any allied stacks of the defending stack.

Only the stack leader may initiate combat.

Resolution of battle.

Victory:
	Loser flees into province
	Winner takes loser's place unless ATTACK 1 flag.
	Booty, prisoners.

Naval combat.

Combat
------

Combat occurs when one unit attacks another unit.  The attacking unit
must be the top unit in its stack (or not stacked with any other
characters).  The attack is against the defending unit's stack, not
just the defending unit.

Participants on the battlefield are the nobles and their fighting men.

Other accompanying men, such as peasants, workers, or sailors, do not
participate in battle.

When one man attacks another, the chance that the attacker will kill
the defender is proportional to their attack and defense ratings.

    A(attack=60) vs B(defense=30)     A has a 2/3 chance of killing B
    A(attack=60) vs B(defense=60)     A has a 1/2 chance of killing B

During combat, a random man will be picked, choosen from both sides,
and he will attack a randomly selected enemy.  If the attack succeeds,
the enemy will be killed.  This continues until the battle is over.

Defeated units which are not captured retreat from battle.

may flee into the outlying province.

The victor always has at least a 25% of taking a unit prisoner,
but no better than a 75% chance.


Nobles in combat
----------------

Nobles have strong innate heroic abilities, and so even an unarmed,
untrained noble is a formidable opponent on the battlefield.

An unarmed, untrained noble is rated (attack=80, defense=80).

Combat skills such as archery and swordplay will improve these ratings.

When a noble is wounded, he is taken out of the fight, and suffers a
1-100 loss of health.  Nobles already wounded when they enter combat
thus run a greater risk of death on the battlefield.  Because nobles
may fall ill as a result of their injuries, even those who survive
may later die from their wounds.

See the section on health for more information on wounds, illness and
healing.


Fortifications
--------------

Structures which may aid fighters in battle are rated for
their defensive bonus.

	Castle Imperius [gx56], castle, defense 25

During battle, the fortification rating is added to the defense
number for each of the men inside the structure.

The structure may take hits during the battle, reducing its
defensive rating.  Once the defense rating reaches zero,
further hits may cause the building to become damaged.
A fully damaged building (100% damage) will collapse, ejecting
its occupants.


Siege engines
-------------

Hmmm.

Increase fort level from n to n+1 requires one worker to work n days,
pay n gold.

1.  Structure may take a hit.  Each hit reduces the fort level by one.
    Once fort level reaches zero, each hit increases damage by one.
    Once damage is at 100%, the structure is destroyed.

2.  The number of men protected by different structures:

	Castle			first 500
	Tower			first 100
	Galley or roundship	first 50
	Other structures	first 50

3.  Siege engines

	delivers 3-5 hits against a fortification
	catapults may fire from behind
	rams and siege towers must be used in front

		catapult*	25	25
		battering ram	30	20
		siege tower	20	30

		* - missile weapon

4.  Have only one rating for structures ?
	fortify/repair raises it
	combat, natural forces lowers it

	Excess over 100 is defensive bonus
	Cost is 5 days, 5 gold to repair points < 100
	Each point over 100 costs one additional day and one gold.


Other factors
-------------

1.  The side with the best tactician gets a free round of attacks
    at the start of battle.

    If both sides have no unit skilled in Tactics, or if the tacticians 
    are equally matched, then neither side will gain a free round of
    attacks.

    The best tactician for each side will be chosen, regardless of
    where in the stack he may be.

2.  Knights and elite guard receive a -25 penalty to both their
    attack and defense ratings when fighting in a swampy province.

3.  In wind, the attack rating for crossbowmen, archers and
    elite archers is halved.  In rain, the attack rating for
    missile fighters is reduced to their defense rating.

4.  When battling on the ocean, siege engines are not used.

    Knights and elite guard receive a -25 penalty to both their
    attack and defense ratings.

    If the galley is fitted with a ram, it will behave like a
    battering ram on land.
