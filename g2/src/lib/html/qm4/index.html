No apprentice magician can rightfully don the robes of his order without
some knowledge of Magic [800].  Magic contains many spells useful on
their own, as well as in conjunction with spells from the other schools 
of sorcery.

The following skills may be studied directly once Magic is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   801    Meditate                           two weeks
   802    Perform common tasks for gold      two weeks
   803    Appear common                      two weeks
