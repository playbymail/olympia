"build monument"

remove doc forget order

Delete item_orb from source and db; orbs are unique

Include hades combat monster table in list of monsters table.

Make somewhere where it is always raining, foggy, etc.

	Isle of Fog
	Rainlands
	Coldwind mountains

Weather magic:
	Notify other weather mages in region when a storm is
		created
	Make noticing storms implicit

Safe havens count as 2 civ instead of 1.  keep this?  change it to what?
should starter cities have a higher civ contribution?



Required for startup:
---------------------

1.	New entity coding system

2.	Characters belonging to new players should be invisible for
	the first five turns, unless they perform a prominent action.

	"A new faction cannot be seen by other players for 5 turns unless it
	 interacts with another unit.  Upon interaction, the unit initiating
	 the interaction becomes visible to other units in the area.  At the
	 end of 5 turns, all units in the new faction become visible.
	 Interaction includes combat, trading, or any other action that
	 involves another unit."

3.	Character vaporize on player quit

4.	Create a new ascii map and update the map generator
	a.  subloc seeding moves into the engine
	b.  cluster like kinds of locations together for naming purposes

5.	How to choose the starting city?  An entry on the startup form?
	Just one starting city?

6.	Distribution of initial skills
	(all starter cities should be port cities)

	120    Shipcraft		any port city
	121    Combat			any city
	122    Stealth			common city
	123    Beastmastery		rare city
	124    Persuasion		rare city
	125    Construction		common city
	126    Alchemy			rare city
	128    Forestry			city in forest region
	129    Mining			city in mountain
	150    Religion			temple
	160    Magic			starter city
	161    Weather magic		Cloudlands
	162    Scrying			rare city (Faery?)
	163    Gatecraft		rare city
	164    Artifact construction	auraculum
	165    Necromancy		rare city (Hades?) (City of the Dead)


	Notes:  Scrying would then become the "elven magic".  Perhaps
		move banish undead there.

		Would have to make City of the Dead as the center loc
		in Hades.  Perhaps get rid of the hidden links.  Don't
		let Hades monsters go in there.

7.  Fix tradegoods again
	at least one rare produce, consume for each region
	bigger qty's of tradegoods, especially high weight ones
	add leather to sell list (buy list?) in a few plains cities

8.  Fix artifact construction


Would be nice to have:
----------------------

1a.	Add some research skills to each category
1b.	Research outside of a tower

	120    Shipcraft		port city or ship
	121    Combat			tower or castle
	122    Stealth			city
	123    Beastmastery		wilderness province
	124    Persuasion		city
	125    Construction		city
	126    Alchemy			tower
	128    Forestry			forest
	129    Mining			mine
	150    Religion			temple
	160    Magic			tower
	161    Weather magic		tower
	162    Scrying			tower
	163    Gatecraft		tower
	164    Artifact construction	tower
	165    Necromancy		tower


2.	CACHE command

3.	Catch flying horses in the cloudlands

4.	Implement advanced sorcery

5a.	Lore delivery for locations

5b.	Uldim Pass / Summerbridge

	Uldim Pass receives heavy snows in winter, closing
	it to travel.  During the winter months there is
	no passable route between Antresk and Mt. Uldim.
	During the spring season of Snowmelt Uldim Pass
	again becomes open for passage.

	Snows begin falling on Uldim Pass during the month
	of Waning days.  Travelers caught in Uldim Pass when
	it closes will be trapped there until spring.


	The lands of Summerbridge receive heavy seasonal rains
	beginning in the fall, making them unpassable.  From
	fall through spring the lands of Aethelarn and Caburh
	in the south are cut off from East and West Urvil in
	the north.  Only when the heat of summer comes do the
	swamps dry enough to permit passage.

	Travelers caught in Summerbridge when the rains begin
	in the first month of fall will find themselves trapped
	in the swamps until the following summer.


10.	Epic fantasy plot

10a.	Lore skill
	Researching lore yields a lore sheet describing a legend
	Don't get a legend if it's already happened
	Others are classified to the age which they might happen

10b.	Legend/plot system

	0.	Other legends


	1.	Age One -- The Emperor is Crowned

	1a.	A king must build a citadel in Areth Pirn
	1b.	The new emperor gets Crown, Sceptre and Chalic
	1c.	Emperor cannot be defeated in battle while he holds his
		three relics.
	1d.	Also gets some imperial troops


	2.	Age Two -- Rise of the Dark Overlord

	2a.	Must journey to Hades, defeat spirit of the ancient
		wizard Fel-methizar to obtain the Book of Secrets.
		Only a necromancer can defeat him.  Must solve riddles.
	2b.	Book of Secrets has a spell which creates the evil
	        artifact "The Chain".  Requires 10 mithril.  Must be
		forged in the circle of stones on Mt. Olympus.
	2c.	Chain can defeat the emperor
	2d.	Chain grants control of legion of orc and undead units.


	3.	Age Three -- Fall of the Emperor
	?.	King of Hades guards the Sceptre of the Dead in Hades


Auto-attack ships: seize_slot or not?


Remove ability to name regions from rules

Make artifact for getting into hades; add lore for it

(9.  better attitude system?

	declare who {hostile unfriendly defend admit stack give} )

Oly times gets birds eye view of Imperial city, and some turn report stuff

Put wandering monsters into their own faction

How to not get angry peasants from the other side?  Maybe one shouldn't
pick up the men as booty?

Curse noncreator loyalty is commented out

New skills to add:

Storms should damage Ships

1.  make bogs in plains; same stuff as swamps

1.  random lucky bonuses

	While studying X, %s came across ...
	While researching X, %s came across ...
		found a rare book about ZZ
		discovered <new unrelated skill>
		accidentally made <rare artifact>
	find raft with some sailors on it

1.  Ability to hide a structure or sublocation so only an explore could find it.

1.  Need more (non-essential) things to spend money on

	expensive spell ingredients at market
	band of mercenaries
	    HIRE <unit> <gold>
		highest bidder at end of turn gets the unit to stack with it
	    mercenaries deduct gold until UNSTACKED or unit can't pay anymore
	    dissolve/disband on unstack?
	    perhaps mercanaries don't appear in garrisoned/castle/civ cities

	    Mercenary band [523], with 12 soldiers, 3 elite guard, for hire
	    Mercenary [523], soldiers, number: 12, for hire

	    unit goes indep -> 50% chance men split and become mercenary unit

	mercenaries pillage 1 and wander when not employed

	ruler of the mercenaries artifact (!!?)
	mercenary player

	how do they come into existence?
	men who desert join local mercenary band

	merc program:
		in a city?
			if (50%)
				do nothing
			else
				move out
				pillage
				50% enter city again
		city here?
			yes, 50% enter, 50% wander
			no, wander

	replenish merc's when not hired (in cities?)
	create up to n merc's at start of turn

	if men desert and unhired_mercenary_here then add men to merc unit


1.  Wandering monsters should attack garrisons

1.  auto routine for NPC type things:  heavy_drop()
	make sure unit doesn't carry around a lot of crap

1.  Show the top rated characters somehow  Hall of Lords

1.  Faery hills and graveyards require separate view so that you
    can see the multiple exits.

1.  Require artifact to enter hades

1.  bring back advanced sorcery

1.  Split construction into stone building, wood building

	Stone building
	Wood building
	Improve castle walls
	Add crenellations to castle
	Dig moat for castle
	Add drawbridge to castle
	Add wooden gate to castle
	Add iron gate to castle

2.  Advanced castle design

	improve walls
	dig moat
	add crenellations
	add drawbridge
	add iron porticulus
	add iron gate
	build inner stone keep

	missile: crenelations, walls
	other:   moat drawbridge portcullis gate walls

	Castle Blood [xd87], defense 32: walls 4, moat, crenellations,
	drawbridge, stone keep, iron portcullis, iron gate

1.  mining idea
	Expand mine -- creates underground sublocs
	tunnel <dir> command?

1.  destroy_auraculum assert's false
    curse noncreator loyalty doesn't work either

2.  Remove experience stuff from spell writing!

3.  Stealth is weak.  Implement monty's skill.

4.  Artifact construction is weak

6.  There is no way to get some of the required items

7.  better entity allocator, coding scheme; current one is too slow,
    too few entities

8.  make the Staff of Hades artifact, required to enter

10.  Remove expierence?  Or fix it.
	abil scry detection practice then has no purpose!

Nearest grave computation is wrong (hal@ll.mit.edu)

My only grumble is that I was enjoying mapping out the gate system.
Sonce my gate explorer got slaughtered by wilderness baddies, I've explored
little. What's the best way to explore gates? Anyone got any suggestions
on how many guards are needed for safety, and whether a noble with
gatecraft (only) could shift their weight through a gate?

I'd still like an 'evasion' subskill of stealth I could teach my explorers.



Must create more of this kind of feeling:

  "--gate crystal-- Just found a gate crystal!!! Now that is a really nice
   idea, having a very small chance of finding very rare items when mining.
   Kind of makes up for all that poisonous gas and cave ins my miners have
   endured. Are the hooks for this gate crystal in place yet? I haven't seen
   anything about it in any of the skill sheets. If there is any docs on what
   a gate crystal is meant to do, I'd love to see them, but it would be even
   better if there was some way to find rumors in Olympia through explore or
   some such. Then there would be a few nobles who had heard of gate crystals,
   there would be others who knew what they did, and still others who had them
   and had to figure out how to use them. The beginning of a quest system.
   Actually, maybe my artifact noble will be helpful. Anyway this is a very
   nice touch."

Ideas:
     o	Quest system:  approach players every 8-16 turns, deliver them
	into a unique chained quest.  One of these quests active per player
	at a time.

	Perhaps give a unique map to a character.  USEing map in target
	province generates the subloc.

	Old man gives rare artifact.  Must be used to defeat beast...

     o	Rescue char from monster who then vanishes case:

		before vanishing, char gives over another (chained)
		mystery (artifact, whatever)


Make a 'city' keyword like 'garrison'
Perhaps do this with all subkinds?

	city tower garrison etc.

add default attitudes


next:  modify quest to maintain levels

	in seed_subloc_with_monster
	decide what level the monster is to be
	if > 1 then
		look for a free artifact of level l-1
		to require

figure out how to work in the rituals
need tech: how to combine items in a ritual
implement ritual code

perhaps make a new player for the subloc monsters
indep_player is getting pretty big
perhaps consider a no-report flag for the subloc player

have the initial monster seeder do this

tailor monsters more to their sublocs
use savages, others too


modify locate to use scry_show_where
get rid of artifact construction



add subloc monster/quest seeder

implement garrison command

subloc/monster seeder:
	create 0-2 sublocs in each province
	seed with a monster

monster seed:
	choose one of the appropriate beasts
	choice:
		0.  no treasure
		1.  some gold
		2.  indep prisoner swear-on-release
		3.  artifact

artifact create:
	1.  some kind of bonus
	2.  require artifact to defeat some monster
	3.  pair or tri artifact in ritual


monster_seed(level):
	choose appropriate level monster

	then:
		0. no treasure
		1. some gold
		2. a quantity of a rare tradegood
		3. indep prisoner swear-on-release
		4. artifact
			a.  member of a ritual group
			b.  required to defeat a monster

	and:
		0. nothing
		1. choose level-1 artifact necessary to defeat


artifact benefit:
	1.  bonus to attack/defense/missile/aura
	2.  no-sick
	3.  undead wipe out
	4.  elfstone

artifact purpose
	1.  required to defeat monster
	2.  member of ritual group


attack/defense/missile/aura/no-sick boost for items
(monster, item) pair such that monster can only be defeated with item
special prisoner flag:  prisoner swears to noble on release

	seed_artifact(art, level)

	select ready sublocs
	seed hardcoded artifacts

	while sublocs remain
		choose a level
		art = make_artifact(level);
		seed_artifact(art, level);



seed every loc with some production sublocs
review list of goodies; make sure they can all be found somewhere

Put all non-research skills into rules

Locate artifact:	(char too?)
	region only if you're not in the region
	province if you're not in the province
	who
Check that reveal vision works the same


add enough lumber to build a galley to the claim list?

COLLECT until have a certain number

replace cookie system with list of summoned units

arrival/departure message: show departure when the unit really moves...

Have riding horses be sold in some cities

Knights and elite guards used to have the "animal" flag set, so their
horses would get bogged down in the swamps.  However, this caused them
to show up as being usable by beastmasters in battle.


Claim stone on a ship could sink it

Kidnap, rescue prisoner, steal item, steal gold

Combat should yield extra loot
	swords and warhorses from dead knights
	pikes from pikemen
	residual gold from unspent maintenance

Rethink the whole load_q/run_q business.  It seems horribly complex.

[look in ../design/Idea]

Implement random monster attacks in wilderness
Give some treasures to Faery hunt, ghost things

1.  Write elven magic category lore sheet
2.  Write some elven magic spells

6.  No building in Faery or Hades
7.  Faery Hunt warning bug


add eat check routine for each command to check sanity of arguments
	johns flag check

Documentation:  group commands into admin, other


Turn off stupid tag shit
Must give appropriate codes to new entities; they can't be referenced
Delete XXX code in faery init
1.  Need names changed this turn section
2.  Document TAG
3.  Document entity tags, naming system in general



heuristic for newly formed nobles, savages, etc.
fold into set_name?

tag command
auto heuristic tagging on set_name?  Would interfere with TAG
How can TAG be used to set another unit's tag...?
NAME
SET n NAME ...
SET n TAG ...

remove redundant prov_dest from entity_misc, seed.c
move banner into entity_misc

stealth:  steal gold from character

Extend hidden mechanism for location:
	hidden -1: 	anyone can find
	hidden -2:	no-one can find -- only one who has already found it
	hidden n:	only n can find
	Must have check to clean up lost n case:
		no longer T_char, change to -1

Make explore_event code

	generate monster
	attacks player
	2 possible outcomes:
		1.  player wounded, some men lost, ejected from subloc
		2.  player wins, beast killed
	if victorious, a reward:
		some gold
		rescued new units joins player's faction & stacks (only once)
		given an artifact
		artifact may be hook to another adventure:
			a map
			father of beast is now mad (?)
			rescued unit makes request (?)

QUEST command

HUNT command
	hunt [beast]
		search subloc for them
		attack
		fail, eject from subloc
		win, make beasts items

Religion
	Pray to god?
	Consecrate temple (to god)
	Wrath of the gods (Summon wrath)
	May not know combat (?)

Beastmastery
	capture beasts in battle, or explore turns them up?

Stealth
	Steal gold from character
		magic purse -- made with alchemy -- cries out when theived
	Doc that all stealth skills are done alone


Artifacts:
	map -- shows how to get into a certain place in a province
	book -- learn rare skill
	100% use rings: horse catching, fishing
	banish undead artifact -- a golden glow suffuses the province
	Scepter of the Dead
		Gives graveyard views, survey of graveyards

			use <item> <loc>		??
			gives report of that grave.
		or
			use <item> <loc>
			causes undead nasties to rise there, if cookie

Scrolls suck
	Religion -- make Holy runes [] only able to write it
	Separate cateogry for each magical skill
	Alchem writes all others
	remove one-shot use -- only one-shot learn


What's this magic_known thing?  Either get rid of it,
	or have forget decrement aura,
	or use it in summary.c

Close trade items may be too profitable.
	there should be at least a few provinces distance between them

make a subkind chain
or perhaps convert threads to be ilists instead
	faster?
	loop_city, loop_province, etc.

civ/wild plan


Build road
	requires workers only
	50% chance of decay each turn -- 6-12%
	admit
	fee, willpay

Give first skill learned by a noble in zero time,
	or give first n skills learned by a faction in zero time

2.  What to do about swear/form FT's.
	leadership
	optional flag
	default visible?

5.  Explore enhancements
	generate npc's
	generate treasure
		rare artifact
		book teaching skill
		gold
		character who joins faction

Issues:
	explore generates npc's in some places
		find rare artifact
		artifact to banish all undead in a province
	refund NP's when a character dies
	perhaps swear downgrades from oath to contract
	allow swear?
	loy_check in unit_deserts is now unused
	stealth
	weather effects on ships
		boost sail time
		storm at sea
	fold savage summoning into common cookie code

Generalize game parameter to oly engine
	for email return addresses
	perhaps put it in the system file

Do all subloc seeding in engine
	at least one graveyard each region
		nearest graveyard field
	new city seeding

	nearest everything field?  Can los or otherwise compute distance (?)

1.  Beast breeding
	combat attack vs. beasts should snag the beasts into the inventory
	or should that be a separate skill?

	what about Form beasts into unit?

Combat
	Capture wild beasts in battle

Beastmastery
	Use animals in combat

	(don't include animal fighters unless true)
	set animal flag for all animals, (including winged horses?)

HUNT command?  Or Capture wild beasts in battle?

animals should have a chance of dying in batttle, even if they
aren't in the combat.  perhaps make an array of them and kill off 10%.

	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
		if (rnd(1,10) == 1)
			kill(l[i]):

Hunt for NOTYET's

virtual artifacts -- when one found, make rest disappear

city seeder sucks; there are large regions with no cities

	instead, choose number of cities to be distributed in each region
	then randomly place them.

...will be used for city/market planning


Allow magician to train

	more men than usual
Don't let savage king unstack his mates

If savage arrives and fort is unoccupied, just take it
	(init_savage_attacks)

get "wait time n" right in pending commands list.
Why not just use a wait > 0 delay?  Oh, the or clause junk.  Special case?

don't gen any savages if # of savage nobles > 250
don't call init attack phase if # > 100


3.  RECLAIM command.  Simply consumes indep's.
	must effectively do a kill_char
	but no loyalty hit
	kill_char must reclaim np's
	need an np_worth function

    Returns 1 NP / NP's to faction of others.

must limit savage units more harshly -- but how?
	n:1 with summoner?

scale tax income to repair level of castle

Limit summons to once per month per location.

add capability of npc's to sail ships to npc_move()
	selkie's delight example

	o  So-and-so has been given the quest of finding the %s.
	   Find it first.

	o  The terrible lion/wolf/whatever has been plaguing the town

Magical scrying spells should always alert the victim of the fact
that they're being scried.  Additional detection spells can tell
them who is doing it.

Spell idea:

	Observe Gatecraft casts
		Will show spells cast by magicians who use gatecraft
		magic in the same location, including jumps from other

Allow attacks, interaction with visible subloc owners

Undead kingdom:
	check 'u' for undead
	doc undead form
	npc take_prisoners, take_unit_items

		disallow quit, although divorce player from faction

start players with up to five characters

yew grove every other mountain or forest

1.  REPAIR / FORTIFY
	Document new fort defense, damage approach
	combat: effective defense is reduced by damage
	fortify: costs defense*100 gold per level, level worker-days
	repair: costs: one worker-day per point (?)
		five gold per point
		or less for a ship?
	make some complete tables

2.  Combat skills:
	Deal critical blow

	Wire Swordplay, Archery into combat model
	Lore sheet for Swordplay, Archery

mapgen: make more gates, there's not enough
	put some around starting cities (!)
	should probably be bidir, or go out and back to another
	starting city

mapgen: smaller map
	clump like terrain types into land regions
	give each a name

get rid of experience rating on skills

Combat:
	b.  Galley rams for sea combat (implement as item in galley?)
	c.  Longer rounds to make fuzzier ties?

	d.  The side with the best tactician gets a free round of attacks
	    at the start of battle.

	    If both sides have no unit skilled in Tactics, or if the
	    tacticians are equally matched, then neither side will gain
	    a free round of attacks.

	    The best tactician for each side will be chosen, regardless of
	    where in the stack he may be.

	e.  When battling on the ocean, siege engines are not used.

	    Knights and elite guard receive a -25 penalty to both their
	    attack and defense ratings.

	    If the galley is fitted with a ram, it will behave like a
	    battering ram on land.


"No researchable skills exist in this category"

Yeah, SACK a city.  Neat.  It would have to be hard to do, and take a
while (like all month).  Maybe I'll add it, though, it sounds fun and
easy to code.  :-)



One noble can hold any number of prisoners currently, without any
support from other men-as-inventory or nobles.

This does seem unrealistic.  Maybe there should be a chance of the
prisoner(s) killing the noble and escaping.

By the way, Marquis is the more normal form of spelling Marquess.
The British corrupt many french words, and marquess is the
literal spelling for the corrupted pronunciation, but most
enlightened folks can pronounce Marquis correctly, especially us
Americans who love the frogs, except when NATO is involved.

That's a good idea.  Each crown has a rating saying how many units it
controls.  Perhaps this rating could rise or fall based on the barbarian's
performance.  Hmmm.

It seems you have set auto attack to be transparent for ships.  1 problem,
my ship sat in the same province all turn auto attacking an empty ship.  I
spent the entire month doing this.   Perhaps a failed attack should
take 0 days ALWAYS.  Perhaps I should have sunk the empty ship to put
it out of its misery?  Have ram will travel...

Yah.  But it's nothing you can't do now, just more awkwardly.
Requiring the big up-front investment in scrolls and such to make
the know-it-all book doesn't seem too bad, although I might have to
increase the aura necessary.

Super-valuable artifacts aren't a problem, even player created ones,
as long as they're very hard to make, and they attract nasties who
want to steal it from you.

Hmm...  If I was going to mix technology in with magic, I would do so in a
19th Centry style, or better yet, more fantastical, as in Jules Verne. 
(OK, maybe i would put a hidden ciy somewhere with a crashed space probe
with a functioning AI ;-)

What I would think of adding to the game would be a new building type of
University.  And you could have Depts. of 

  - Biology/Druidicism, could be a whole complement to the Magic system
  - Engineering (IMHO- the construction skill is sort of unfounded, you
just don't learn engineering principles in seven days).  In game terms,
would effect percetages:  how long to build, chance to a mine collapsing,
etc.  Special skill of tunnelling to collapse castle walls.
  - Minerology - increase yields of mining.  Advanced skill of smelting if
you want to introduce more advanced metals which leads to better weapons.
  - Literature - steering public opinion???  (If you ever played Midgard,
there was the idea that you carried a "reputation" with you, good, bad, or
unknown)  It could also affect recruiting.
  - Commerce - percentage affecting your buy/sell price and quantity.

Hmm...  where I seem to be leading is a way to get a skill that alters the
percentages of "yield" of other skills by having an educations.

Whatcha think?

I need clarification on the issue of in what situations COLLECT commands
can be issued from within sublocations.  The rules state that peasants
can't be recruited from anywhere except within a city; I presume
fish can be collected from within the sublocation of a ship; other than
that it doesn't say.  In particular, can I QUARRY from within
a castle-in-progress?

(You might also want to put more details on this into the rulebook for
the benefit of other players.)

Thanks,

- Russell
