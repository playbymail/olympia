      "WANTED - SEA MAPS
       
       I, Captain Pickle, have desperate need for a new
       cartographer.  I was forced to make Sam Snacker
       walk the plank when all of his maps were drawn
       upside down.  I am willing to pay 400 gold for a
       good map of the seas and land off the coast of
       Port Aurnos.
       
       Please contact me at 5151@g2.pbm.com.
