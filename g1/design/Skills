	Extract venom from ratspider [9549]
	Make potion of slavery [9550]

-----------------------------

Weaponsmithing [127]

The skill of producing weapons and armor from raw materials.
The weaponsmith is a craftsman with the ability to turn yew
into bows, iron into swords and wood into pikes.  The making
of all weapons and armor falls under this skill, as well as
some limited knowledge of siegecraft.

-----------------------------

Mining [129]

Mining is the skill of sinking deep shafts into mountainous
provinces for the purpose of extracting valuable elements.
Most mining skills require a mine shaft to be constructed
first with Build mine [9562].  Quarry building stone [9566]
is an exception.  Building stones may be cut on the surface
in mountain provinces.

The likelihood of death because of cave-ins or poisonous gases
seeping into the shafts tends to make mining dangerous work.

	Quarry building stone [9566]
	Build mine [9562]
	Mine iron [9563]
	Mine gold [9564]

Further skills within this category may be found through
research or other means.

	Mine mithril [9565]

-----------------------------

Skill:  Train peasant to sailor [9501]

Usage:  USE 9501

Requires:  one peasant [10]
Produces:  one sailor [19]
Time:	   seven days

The peasant is taught everything necessary to sail ocean-going sea
vessels.  Reliable rope-work, handling of rigging and sails, and
piloting through narrow channels are all learned from more experienced
hands.  As a test, the teachers stand by while the new sailor assumes
ship duties for a short cruise.  The sailors and their new shipmate
celebrate with a raucous night of drinking in a seaside tavern.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Pilot ship [9502]

Usage:  USE 9502 <direction or location>
Or:	SAIL <direction or location>

Requires:  character must be ship's captain
Time:      varies with route taken

Pilot a ship in the given direction, or to the specified
location.  If a location is specified, there must be a direct
route to it from the current location of the ship.

Compass points may be abbreviated:  N, S, E, W.

The character issuing the Pilot ship order must occupy the
first position inside the ship (the character must be the
captain of the ship).

The captain must have a crew to assist in the handling of the
ship.  Galleys require fourteen oarsmen to row the ship.  Oarsmen
may be either sailors or slaves.  Roundships require at least eight
sailors to man the ship's rigging.

	ship		crew
	----		----
	galley		14 slaves or sailors
	roundship	8 sailors

If the required number of crew are not available, travel is still
possible, but will take an extra day for each hand the crew is short.

For example, a galley with only 10 men at the oars will take four
extra days to travel across an ocean route.  A roundship with no
sailors at all would take eight extra days to traverse a route.

Galleys perform equally well regardless of wind conditions.
Roundships may be becalmed and unable to travel.  In the presence
of favorable wind they will travel across ocean routes in half
the rated time.

Overloaded ships do not sail well.  They may take longer than
expected to travel across routes, and are almost certain to
capsize and sink in a storm.  Captains should be careful not
to leave port in a vessel carrying too much cargo.

For convenience, one may use the SAIL order rather than "USE 9502".
Knowledge of Pilot ship [9502] is still required, however.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Build galley [9503]

Usage:  USE 9503 "Name of ship"

Requires:  at least three workers [11]
           30 lumber [77]

Time:	   150 worker-days

A galley, often known as a warship, is a slender rowed vessel
often used for naval combat.  Because of its limited cargo
capacity, galleys are not appropriate for extended ocean cruises.

Galleys require 14 sailors or slave oarsmen for travel, and may
carry 5,000 units of cargo.  Galleys lend a defensive bonus during
naval combat.  The oars permit the ship to be maneuvered
regardless of wind conditions.  If fitted with a ram, the galley
may also be used to crush the sides of an enemy ship.

To initiate construction of a new galley, the shipbuilder
should unstack from beneath any other characters and issue
the USE 9503 order.  The lumber will be taken from the
shipbuilder's inventory and immediately put to use constructing
the new ship.

To resume construction of a partially completed galley, first
enter the ship, then issue USE 9503.

Work progresses until 150 worker-days have been invested in the
construction.  At completion, the ship will be christened and
declared seaworthy.

Ships may only be built in ocean port regions.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Build roundship [9504]

Usage:  USE 9504 "Name of ship"

Requires:  workers, 75 lumber
Time:	   300 worker-days

The roundship, also known as the merchantman, is a deep,
wide sailing ship, usually with one or two masts and steered
with great, oar-like paddles.  The large cargo space makes it
well suited for trade and extended ocean travel.

Roundships provide no defensive bonus at sea.  While they
make good time at sea under a favorable wind, even when
fully loaded, roundships are rather clumsy to maneuver.
They are vulnerable to attacks from rowed galleys.

Roundships require a crew of eight sailors travel, and may
carry 25,000 units of cargo.

To initiate construction of a new roundship, the shipbuilder
should unstack from beneath any other characters and issue
the USE 9504 order.  The lumber will be taken from the
shipbuilder's inventory and immediately put to use constructing
the new ship.

To resume construction of a partially completed roundship, first
enter the ship, then issue USE 9504.

Work progresses until 300 worker-days have been invested in the
construction.  At completion, the ship will be christened and
declared seaworthy.

Ships may only be built in ocean port regions.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Repair ship [9505]

Usage:  USE 9505

Requires:  at least one worker
           one gold [1] per point of damage

Time:      varies with number of workers and amount of damage

To repair a damaged ship, the character must first enter the
ship, then issue USE 9505.  Each worker will repair one point
of damage in one day, using one gold to cover the costs of
repair.

Multiple characters may use 9505 to repair a ship at the same
time.  Characters engaged in repair work may be anywhere within
the ship; they do not need to be in the first position.

The skill completes when the ship is fully repaired, or the
character runs out of gold.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Train peasant to worker [9506]

Usage:  USE 9506

Requires:  one peasant [10]
Produces:  one worker [11]
Time:	   three days

The peasant learns the use of tools, the following of instructions,
and basic skills, such as woodcraft and stone laying, so as to be
useful to various trades as a skilled laborer.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Train peasant to soldier [9507]

Usage:  USE 9507

Requires:  one peasant [10]
	   one pike [75]

Produces:  one soldier [12]

Time:	   five days

The peasant is equipped with a pike and trained in the basics
of following orders, marching, charging, battle formations,
and use of the weapon.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Train soldier to archer [9508]

Usage:  USE 9508

Requires:  one soldier [12]
           one longbow [72]

Produces:  one archer [13]

Time:	   seven days

The soldier trades in his his crude weapon for a longbow and
learns accurate shooting, gauging wind effects, and the
feathering of arrows.

Archers are nearly twice as effective against common soldiers in
battle.  However, windy weather cuts the accuracy of archers in
half, and rain dampens the strings of their longbows, rendering
them useless.  Thus fair weather is vitally important to the
effectiveness of archers.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Train soldier to knight [9509]

Usage:  USE 9509

Requires:  one soldier [12]
	   one warmount [53]
	   one longsword [74]

Produces:  one knight [14]

Time:	   ten days

The soldier first learns to ride his warmount effectively
in a variety of demanding situations.  Instruction in jousting,
swordplay, and tactics to use against pike-wielding foot
soldiers follows.  The knight's education is completed withx
 lessons on loyalty and devotion to one's lord.

A well-trained knight can match three common foot soldiers on
the battlefield.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Train knight to elite guard [9510]

Usage:  USE 9510

Requires:  one knight [14]
           one plate armor [73]

Produces:  one elite guard [15]

Time:	   fourteen days

The knight is put through a demanding series of courses designed
to hone and test his skills.  He is taught the use of all manner
of weapons, subjected to great physical challenges, and practices
great personal discipline.  Knights who thought themselves expert
soldiers at the beginning of their training are soon humbled by
master elite guardsmen.

The elite guard training produces the most feared and deadly
soldiers known in these lands.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Expand ship capacity [9511]

Usage:  USE 9511

Requires:  three workers or sailors
Time:      three days

This skill represents knowledge of how to store cargo on ships
for optimal space consumption, stable weight distribution,
preservation of spoilable goods, and prevention of from theft
by one's own crew.  Even passengers may be convinced to make do
with minimal space within the ship.

The character should enter the ship and issue the USE 9511 order.
This will repack the ship's cargo to obtain a 30% improvement
in capacity.  Cargo cannot be repacked twice; space savings
greater than 30% are not possible.

Removing and reloading cargo will undo the effects of repacking.
One way to use this skill is first to fully load the ship (perhaps
exceeding the ship's capacity rating).  Before sailing, issue the
USE 9511 order to repack the ship's cargo.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Torture prisoner [9512]

Usage:  USE 9512 <prisoner> <flag>
Time:   seven days

Torture is the practice of inflicting pain on a captive prisoner in
order to extract information against the victim's will.

The flag specified with the USE 9512 order indicates what questions
the prisoner will be asked:

	flag	interrogation
	----	-------------
	 1	Learn the name of the character's lord
	 2	Learn what skills the character possesses
	 3	Learn what skills the character's lord possesses
	 4	Learn any secret routes the character may know of
	 5	Learn the names of any followers of the character

Torture is not a reliable means of extracting information from
a character.  The character may lie or simply refuse to talk.
There is a good chance that the character will die under the
brutal effects of torture.


Perhaps:

	Pass in <severity>, how hard they are to be tortured.

	USE 9512 <prisoner> <flag> <severity>

	oath loyalty:	<severity> / 2 chance that they will talk
	contract:	<severity> chance
	fear:		<severity> * 2 chance that they will talk

-----------------------------

Skill:  Guard noble [9513]

Usage:  USE 9513 <character> <days>
Time:   days as specified above

The character, with the assistance of any followers available,
will vigilantly guard the specified noble against harm and will
attempt to foil any kidnapping or assassination attempts.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Guard item [9514]

Usage:  USE 9514 <item> <days>
Time:   days as specified above

The character will vigilantly stand guard over an item to protect
against its theft.  Any followers of the character will also aid
in the object's protection.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Bribe noble [9515]

Usage:  USE 9515 <character> <gold>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to lower the target's loyalty to its current lord with a
gift of gold.  If the noble becomes sufficiently dissatisfied with
its current position, it may swear fealty to the gifting character.

The amount of loyalty erosion is proportional to the size of the gift
and the receiving character's skills and importance.  The more loyal,
experienced and skilled the noble, the harder he will be to bribe.
An extremely loyal noble may refuse the bribe entirely.

The noble to be bribed must be in the current region.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Persuade noble [9516]

Usage:  USE 9516 <character>
Time:   seven days

Erode a noble's loyalty to its current lord with silver-tongued
arguments and gentle persuasion.  Later, as the will of the subject
weakens, more forceful barbs and coercions are used.  If a character
can be made sufficiently unhappy in its current position, it will
swear fealty to the persuading character.

Experienced, highly skilled characters are harder to persuade than
young, untrained nobles.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Catch wild horses [9517]

Usage:  USE 9517
Time:   seven days

Attempt to catch any wild horses found roaming the plains.  Unbroken
horses may be quite violent.  A great deal of skill is needed to
safely catch and handle them.

Success at horse catching cannot be reliably predicted.  Some weeks
may yield few new stallions, or none at all.  Characters may be
unusually fortunate other times and return with several wild horses.

Wild horses are only found in plains regions.  Use of this skill
will fail if attempted in any other kind of terrain.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Steal item from character [9518]

Usage:  USE 9518 <character> <item>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to rob the specified character of the given item.
Thievery is dangerous; a failed attempt may lead to harm,
death or capture.  The thief's chances of success are
diminished if the target is guarding the object of interest
or is otherwise unusually vigilant.

In some instances, the victim will catch the thief in the act
of robbery, but the thief will escape with the object anyway.
In such cases the identity of the thief will be made known.

Stealing from magicians is not recommended.  They are said to
have mysterious ways of safeguarding their possessions, and
horrible punishments reserved for criminals who offend them.

The thief must be in the same location as the target.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Determine inventory of character [9519]

Usage:  USE 9519 <character>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to sneakily learn the contents of the specified
character's inventory.  Attempts are not always successful.
If caught caught while rummaging through the target's
possessions, the spy may be harmed or captured.

The spy must be in the same region as the target.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Determine skills of character [9520]

Usage:  USE 9520 <character>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to sneakily learn in what skills the specified
character is proficient by crafty observation and spying.

Unsuccessful attempts may cause the spy to be discovered,
harmed or captured.

The spy must be in the same region as the target.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Determine character's lord [9521]

Usage:  USE 9521 <character>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to learn the identity of the lord to whom the
specified character has sworn fealty.  In some cases this
is easily determined by observation at a safe distance.
In others, the spy may need to risk eavesdropping on or
following the target.  Unfortunate spies may discovered,
harmed or captured in their attempts.

The spy must be in the same region as the target.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Determine vassals of a noble [9522]

Usage:  USE 9522 <character>
Time:   seven days

Learn the identity of all characters who have sworn fealty
to the target.  This may required the spy to risk
eavesdropping on or following the target.  In some rare
cases the information will be widely known and thus easily
obtained.  Unsuccessful spies may be discovered in their
attempts.  Harm or capture is possible.

The spy and target must be in the same region.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Increase loyalty of vassal [9523]

Usage:  USE 9523 <character>
Time:   seven days

Increase the given noble's loyalty to his sworn lord through
praise and honor.  The skill user will recount the noble's
achievements under his current lord, and express the lord's
satisfaction with the noble's service.  The noble may be
presented with honors in front of his peers and followers.
The target will be made to feel well-liked and sure of
promotion within his position.

The effect will be to diminish the chances that the target
will be persuaded to renounce fealty to his current lord.

The skill user need not be the target's lord, nor do the two
characters have to be in the same faction.  The skill user
must be in the same location as the target, however.

-----------------------------

#Skill:  Incite mob violence [9525]

Usage:  INCITE <mob> <target>
Time:   seven days

Speak out against the target in such as a way as to inspire
public hatred and ire.  The target will be made to seem a
malicious influence responsibile for all of the common man's
troubles.

An existing crowd of peasants must be specified as the first
argument, and the target of their violence as the second.

There is a 50% chance that the mob will be roused to attack
the target.

There is also a 33% chance that patrons in any local inns will
learn that the noble is trying to incite a mob to violence
against the target.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Repair structure [9526]

Usage:  USE 9526

Requires:  workers
Time:      varies

Use workers to repair a damaged structure.  Each worker will repair
one point of damage per day.  The skill usage completes when the
building is is fully repaired.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Improve city walls [9527]

Usage:  USE 9527 <days>

Requires:  workers, building stone
Time:      as given above

Each worker will add one unit of stone to the city's walls per day,
improving the location's defenses.  The character should be directly
inside the city region.

City walls are rated on a 0-100 scale.  Each point of defensive
rating represents 100 stones.  The maximum number of stones city
walls may contain is 10,000.

Attacks against the city may cause portions of the walls to be
destroyed, especially if siege engines are used in the attack.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Assess city walls [9528]

Usage:  USE 9528 <city>
Time:   three days

The character will inspect the specified city's walls, looking for
weakness and determining their defensive value in battle.  City
walls are rated on a 0-100 scale.  The city wall's rating will be
shown.

The assessor must be either inside or in the same region as the
walled city.

		[Chance that skill use notifies location owner]

-----------------------------

Skill:  Train wild horse to riding horse [9529]

Usage:     USE 9529

Requires:  one wild horse [51]
Produces:  one riding horse [52]

Time:      seven days

Wild horses are first broken to saddle, then trained to respect
and obey whatever riders they may serve.  Once broken, riding
horses become too timid and docile to be of any use in battle.

Time:   seven days

Attempt to murder the specified character with secret or
treacherous means.  The assassin will employ poison, concealed
weapons, or traps to dispatch his victim.  The assassin may use
stealth to get close to the target, or may masquerade as one of
the victim's own followers.

The assassin's chances of success are diminished if the target is
actively guarded.  A failed attempt may lead to harm, capture or
death.  Even in successful assassinations, there is a chance that
the killer's identity may be discovered.

Assassination is a lone activity, relying on stealth for success.
Followers of the character will not participate in the attempt.

The assassin must be in the same location as the target.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Kidnap character [9533]

Usage:  USE 9533 <target>

-----------------------------

Skill:  Capture wild beast [9534]

The beast must be located in the character's region.  The beast
need not be immediately visible; the character will hunt for it
if it is hiding.

Capturing beasts does not always success, and can be quite
dangerous.  Wild animals are often violent and unpredictable.
Furthermore, they may be difficult to find when hiding.  The
beast may fail to be enchanted by the beastmaster's charms,
and instead attack its pursuer.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Win beast's mind [9535]

Usage:  USE 9535 <beast>
Time:   fourteen days

complete control of the animal will be achieved.

If successful, the animal will become part of the beastmaster's
faction, obeying orders as any other character unit would.
Of course, beasts are not capable of all of the actions available
to a noble.  However, they will respond to movement and combat
commands, and will report everything a normal character would see
in a region.

Winning control of a beast's mind is a tricky, delicate task, not
often successful.  Repeated attempts may be necessary.

-----------------------------

Skill:  Free prisoner [9536]

Usage:  USE 9536 <character>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to free the specified noble who is being held captive.
Stealth will be used to slip unnoticed into the enemy's camp,

or prison, and escape.

actively guarded.  The character attempting to free the prisoner

order to attempt to free him.

-----------------------------

months.

Use of @@@@ on a mob already stacked with the noble will renew the

they will remain stacked, to a maximum of five months.

participate in any combat the noble encounters.


-----------------------------

Skill:  Rally peasants to cause [9538]

Usage:  USE @@@@ <number to rally>

gathered which is useful during a raid, such as defensive
tactics of the target, daily patterns, and state of preparedness.

	breed n m [o]

Form beast unit
	requires 1 NP


Construction
	Improve city sewers
		somehow allow a network or maze of sewer
		locations to be constructed underneath the city

Stealth:  sneak into stack
Observation counter: search stack for spies

Siege tower idea:  each tower reduces 1/3 of the locs defenses
	but towers of same kind are not additive; need all
	three for 100% efficiency


Perhaps a Stealth use:

	Prepare for raid

		Increases the chance that a theft, kidnapping or
		assasination will succeed.

		Chance increased is 10% the first use, 8% the
		second, and 6% the third.  No added benfit is
		gained after the third use of the skill, although
		the state of enhance preparation will be maintained.

		Only one use per month.

		If a month elapses without a raid or further preparation,
		the benefit of Prepare for raid is lost.

		However, there is a 5% chance of detection with
		each use of Prepare for raid.


Teaching plan:

	Offer shipcraft
	Offer combat
	Offer stealth
	Offer beastmastery
	Offer persuasion
	Offer construction
	Offer alchemy
	Offer weaponsmithing
	Offer forestry
	Offer mining

	Author book ?

Offer mining [] will add a mining skill use to the list
of skills which a mining guild offers.

A guild may only offer skills within the same skill
family.  The skill school must be offered by the guild
before any subskill can be added.

For instance, Offer mining must first be used on skill
129 before any of the mining subskill can be added to
the guild.
