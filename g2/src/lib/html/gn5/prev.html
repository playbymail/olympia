Use beasts in battle [653]
--------------------------
Usage:  automatic when needed

This skill grants the beastmaster the ability to control animals
in battle.  Any wild animals in the possession of the beastmaster
will be treated as additional fighters.

For example, a character with 10 soldiers [12] and one lion [280]
who did not know 653 would only use the soldiers in battle.
However, a beastmaster with knowledge of 653 would also employ
the lion in combat.

Only the beasts directly possessed by the beastmaster will aid
combat.  Animals owned by units which do not possess knowledge
of 653 will not be used in battle.

The following animals may be used in combat:

    nazgul [55]          (80,80,0)
    centaur [271]        (30,30,0)
    minotaur [272]       (30,5,0)
    giant spider [278]   (150,100,0)
    rat [279]            (3,3,0)
    lion [280]           (100,100,0)
    giant bird [281]     (200,150,0)
    giant lizard [282]   (45,45,0)
    chimera [284]        (130,130,0)
    harpie [285]         (80,120,0)
    dragon [286]         (500,500,250)
    gorgon [288]         (10,20,0)
    wolf [289]           (5,5,0)
    hound [295]          (1,1,0)
