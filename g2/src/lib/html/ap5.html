Combat [610]
------------
The student of combat learns the training of soldiers and how
to lead them well in battle.  With study and experience, the
battle lord will find strategies to be used in difficult combat
situations.

The following skills may be studied directly once Combat is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   611    Survive fatal wound                four weeks
   612    Fight to the death                 four weeks
   613    Construct catapult                 two weeks
   614    Defense                            two weeks
   615    Archery                            three weeks
   616    Swordplay                          two weeks
   617    Weaponsmithing                     two weeks



Train wild horse to riding horse [656]
--------------------------------------
Usage:     MAKE 52

Requires:  one wild horse [51]
Produces:  one riding horse [52]

Time:      three days

Wild horses are first broken to saddle, then trained to respect
and obey whatever riders they may serve.  Once broken, riding
horses become too timid and docile to be of any use in battle.
