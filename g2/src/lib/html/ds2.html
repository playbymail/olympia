      "WARS BEGIN BECAUSE OF A LACK OF COMMUNICATION.
       There is a lot happening in and around Drassa.
       Claims are being staked. Castles built.
       And alliances formed. There will soon be
       2 types of factions in Drassa. Those in the loop,
       and those out of the loop.  Don't be left out of the loop.
       Email  Seehawk42@aol.com and inform Eric
       that your faction is in the Drassa region.  You will
       quickly be informed of all other factions that reply.
       We can use this mailing list to keep each other
       informed of claims and such before conflict arises.
       Let's strive to keep the Drassan region peaceful.
       There are strong alliances forming elsewhere.
       Only a peaceful and united region can stand up
       to these alliances. Contact Eric at
       Seehawk42@aol.com  if you are interested
       in joining other like minded factions that strive
       for peace through a strong and united defense."
