The legend of the Crown, Scepter and Chalice
--------------------------------------------

The three artifacts have been lost.  Nasty monsters are guarding them.
A king must take all three to mount Zukko in Torba Bacor, and there
peform the sacred ritual (issue the USE command for one of the artifact).

The ritual will claim the Emperorship for the king, and give him vast
powers.

Which are:
	build citadel skill ?
	raise imperial guard units
	imperial income based



1.  GARRISON <kind> <number> [...]

	Install a garrision of men in the location.
	Must be the first unit in the location.
	Cannot be used if there is already a garrison.

	    Garrison [3465], lord Feasel the Great [2311], with 10 soldiers

	Garrison is by default on guard.
	Garrison's attitudes with respect to HOSTILE and DEFEND
	are those of the unit which created it.

	UNGARRISON [who] command.

1a. Initially garrison unpopulated provinces?  Default hostile?

	Garrison [3465], with 10 savages


2.  Each garrisoned province provides 100 gold to offset maint costs.
    Remainder is forwarded to the owner.

	lord		1-3
	baron		4-8
	count		9-13
	earl		14-19
	marquess	20-25
	duke		26+
