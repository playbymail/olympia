Posted in Yellowleaf:
   Posted by The Illustrated Man [1010]:
      "The Illustrated Man can be seen down at the
       Yellowleaf Public Gardens today, lying in the
       shade and sipping a tall cool one.  He has
       appeased, reasoned, argued, strategized,
       and diplomatized himself almost to a shadow
       of his former robust self, but he is pleased
       with the way things are going.  Tomorrow,
       back to the GCoA outpost in Yellowleaf to
       tackle the Issues of the Day once again!
       Oh well, guess we can't pass a Times issue
       without one serious pronouncement.  OK.
       While the Feb. 1 deadline passed without
       the full recognition of our claim we had
       hoped for, Lady Eowyn made contact with
       us well in advance of that time in order to
       open a dialogue on this and other issues.
       Therefor, we'll consider our conditions to
       be met for now.
       Also, many thanks to Eric the Seehawk
       for his invaluable arbitration, without which
       peace might have been impossible.
       Oh, we're up to spending 6 gp per peasant
       now.  Until this treaty is signed by all parties,
       we're still going to be wary.
       Now, I'm going to take a nap."
