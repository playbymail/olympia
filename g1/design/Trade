For each long-haul tradegood,

	Choose two cities (source, consumer) at least 15 provinces apart
	Choose n=0-1 cities near to producer
	Choose m=0-1 cities near to consumer

	Set qty = 100 + (n-1)*25

		Each source city sells qty/n +- 10%
		Each consumer city buys qty/m +- 10%

	set distance = los(source, consumer)
	set profit = (125.5 + distance) * distance
	set premium = profit/qty

	set source city's cost at base price for item (base price is abitrary)
	set consumer city's cost at base+premium
	set prices for other source cities 1-5% lower
	set prices for other consumer cities 1-5% higher


try land routes within large regions first
	land routes must be at least 20-25 provinces

For each long-haul tradegood,
    Choose two regions, one to produce the good, and one to consume it.
    Within producer region, pick n=[1-3] cities to sell the item.
    Within consumer region, pick m=[1-3] cities to buy the item.

    Set qty = 100 + (n-1)*25

        Each source city sells qty/n +- 10%
        Each consumer city buys qty/m +- 10%

    Choose a source and consumer city.

    set distance = los(source, consumer)
    Set profit = (125.5 + distance) * distance
    Set premium = profit/qty

    Set source city's cost at base price for item
    Set consumer city's cost at base+premium
    Set prices for other source cities slightly lower ( < 5% deviation).
    Set prices for other consumer cities slightly higher ( < 5% deviation).


alternatively:

	pick two clusters of between 1-3 cities at least 10 (15?) provinces
	apart.  may either be separated by land or ocean.

	could be a separate routine to look for long-haul land routes


Notes:

	Cities chosen within regions should be close together, especially
	if the region is large.

	Quantity available to trade increases a bit if multiple cities sell.

	Longer trade routes are a bit more profitable per unit of distance
	than shorter ones.

	Ideally there would be enough unique long-haul tradegoods so that
	each region could produce one or two of them.  So far I've only
	thought of eight long-haul tradegoods.

	By fixing qty, we make lighter tradegoods naturally better than
	than heavier ones.

Non-tradegood city trades:

	port cities buy fish
	all cities buy either clay pots or woven baskets
	plains cities sell oxen
	alchemy cities sell lead

Common (short haul) tradegoods:

	pipeweed
	ale
	tallow
	candles
	wool
	vinegar
	wax
	sugar
	salt
	glue
	linen
	beans
	walnuts
	flax
	flutes
	cassava
	plum wine

	for each region
		construct city list for region
		clear temps on local tradegoods

		for each city in region
			pick new local tradegood from list
				buy/sell it
			choose another city from the region randomly to
				sell/buy it
			set price according to distance, or fixed profit


	this algorithm requires that we have as many local tradegoods
	as there are cities in the region

	there are 39 cities in the biggest region
	but that may be somewhat atypical


Rare (long haul) tradegoods:

	ink
	fine cloaks
	chocolate
	ivory
	rugs
	honey
	spice
	licorice (root)
	soap
	old books
	jade idols
	purple cloth
	rose perfume
	jeweled egg
	ochre
	incense
	oranges
	cinnabar
	myrhh
	saffron

opals
powdered gate crystal
unicorn horn

rare books
leather
cocoa beans, cacao beans
furs (local to a continent, or "north"?)


any way to get jewels?  who buys them?

Ok, let me think...

You grabbed the easy ones.  Jools and rare minerals should be good,
but that might be too easy, given mine production.

      opium
      teak (or other rare woods, let me know if you want a list
	    to pick something more exotic)
      rubber
      joolry
      silk (or other textiles)
      sculpture
      paintings
      etchings (:-)

If you want to include somatic components for magical spells, you
might have:

      python venom
      djinn bottles
      bat wings

etc.
