Harvest yew [703]
-----------------
Usage:     YEW [number] [days]
Times:     as given or necessary
Requires:  at least one worker [11]

Workers enter a yew grove and select yew trees which are suitable for
collection.  Yew is used in the making of longbows.

Must be used in a yew grove.  Yew groves generate 5 yew [68] each month.

Examples:

    yew         # obtain as much yew as possible
    yew 1       # stop after getting 1 wood
    yew 0 4     # cut yew for four days

In all cases, yew harvesting will cease as soon as the grove's supply
of yew for the month has been exhausted.

YEW is an alias for COLLECT 68.


Mining [720]
------------
Mining is the skill of sinking deep shafts into mountainous
provinces for the purpose of extracting valuable elements.
Mining skills require a mine shaft to be constructed first
with the BUILD MINE order.

The likelihood of death because of cave-ins or poisonous gases
seeping into the shafts tends to make mining dangerous work.

The following skills may be studied directly once Mining is known:
