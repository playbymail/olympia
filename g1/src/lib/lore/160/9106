#Spell:  Speed casting of next spell [9106]
#
Usage: USE @@@@ <amount>

Required aura:  amount as specified above
Required item:
Time to cast:   four days

The mage trades aura for time.  The time necessary to cast
the next spell will be reduced by the amount of aura invested
in the cast of [@@@@].

For example, a mage who issued USE @@@@ 5 would lose five current
aura points.  Whatever spell the mage casts next will take five days
less than it normally would.

Uses of @@@@ are additive.
