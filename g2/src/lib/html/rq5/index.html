Shipcraft [600]
---------------
All skills concerning ocean travel fall under this category.
Shipcraft encompasses the building and repair of ships,
training of sailors, and navigation at sea.

The following skills may be studied directly once Shipcraft is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   601    Sailing                            two weeks
   602    Shipbuilding                       two weeks
   603    Fishing                            two weeks



Stealth [630]
-------------
Stealth includes the arts of theft, spying, assassination,
kidnapping, and other covert activities.  Most stealth
skills will not make use of soldiers or other followers,
instead relying on the sneakiness of a lone character.

The following skills may be studied directly once Stealth is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   631    Petty thievery                     two weeks
   632    Determine inventory of character   two weeks
   633    Determine skills of character      two weeks
   634    Determine character's lord         two weeks
   635    Conceal faction                    four weeks

Further skills may be found through research.


Construction [680]
------------------
The domain of engineers, builders and architects, Construction
concerns the erection of inns, castles, city walls, and other
fortifications.

The following skills may be studied directly once Construction is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   681    Construct siege tower              two weeks
   682    Stone quarrying                    two weeks



Perform common tasks for gold [802]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 802 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.
This skill allows the magician to perform trivial or common tasks for
the local population of a city or province to earn gold.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love
potions, dowsing for water, or performing conjuring tricks.

This skill earns 10 gold per day for the mage, while work at common
tasks is available.  Cities and provinces support 5 days of work at
common tasks for each point of civilization level.  For example, a
civ-2 city will allow a mage to work for 10 days at common tasks,
earning 100 gold.

If multiple mages work the same location, they compete for the
available work.  Two mages who each began using 802 on the first
day of the month in a civ-2 province would each work for five days,
and each would earn 50 gold.  See the COLLECT order for more details
regarding competition for resources.
