Stealth [630]
-------------
Stealth includes the arts of theft, spying, assassination,
kidnapping, and other covert activities.  Most stealth
skills will not make use of soldiers or other followers,
instead relying on the sneakiness of a lone character.

The following skills may be studied directly once Stealth is known:

Magic [800]
-----------
No apprentice magician can rightfully don the robes of his order without
some knowledge of Magic [800].  Magic contains many spells useful on
their own, as well as in conjunction with spells from the other schools 
of sorcery.

The following skills may be studied directly once Magic is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------

   802    Perform common tasks for gold      two weeks
   803    Appear common                      two weeks
   804    View current aura level of others  three weeks
   805    Reveal abilities of another mage   two weeks

Further skills may be found through research.


Perform common tasks for gold [802]
-----------------------------------
Usage:  USE 802 [days]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   as given

Even powerful magicians sometimes require gold to further their plans.
This skill allows the magician to perform trivial or common tasks for
the local population of a city or province to earn gold.

Examples of common tasks are curing runny noses, concocting love
potions, dowsing for water, or performing conjuring tricks.

This skill earns 10 gold per day for the mage, while work at common
tasks is available.  Cities and provinces support 5 days of work at
common tasks for each point of civilization level.  For example, a
civ-2 city will allow a mage to work for 10 days at common tasks,
earning 100 gold.

If multiple mages work the same location, they compete for the
available work.  Two mages who each began using 802 on the first
day of the month in a civ-2 province would each work for five days,
and each would earn 50 gold.  See the COLLECT order for more details
regarding competition for resources.
