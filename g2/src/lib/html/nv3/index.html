      "Other players:
       
       I started a little late in the game. Didn't see who was
       around before us. This place seems deserted!
       
       I want to know if anyone is setting up near Port Aurnos
       anywhere. I was planning on building a ship a getting
       out of here, after expecting the place to be
       overpopulated. Now that I'm here I wonder if I might
       just as well set up somewhere near here.
       
       Anyone willing to let me know how many other players
       there are in the nearby regions, or if there is anyone
       who will object to this.
       
       I want to set up, or join, a loose alliance of players
       who want to do there own thing, without having to worry
       about being wiped out by an obnoxious alliance trying to
       "win". Anyone interested in this somewhere near Port
       Aurnos. Note - I am not interested, or trying to set up,
       one of those ridiculous master/vassal alliances, just a
       mutual defense alliance.
       
       Also, is anyone interested in paying for pikes, xbows,
       pikemen, etc?
       
       Way
       3410@g2.pbm.com (hope so anyway)"
