You discover a dull crown of black metal, crudely fashioned.  When
you place it upon your head, you sense the presence of several
bands of undead nearby.  You find these units will respond to
your mental control, and you can issue the following commands to
your undead units:

    ATTACK, BANNER, CONTACT, EXECUTE, GIVE, MOVE, NAME, PILLAGE,
    PROMOTE, RAZE, SEEK, STACK, TAKE, TERRORIZE, UNSTACK, WAIT
