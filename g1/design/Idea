I see the proposals (roughly three, so far) as being very similar.

Clearly, bribing an unsworn has to be significantly more difficult
than hiring him.  I see a lot of room to work here, though.

	maybe it already is
	bribing indeps can be more expensive
	it can have less of a chance of success
	it can be impossible (say, if they're working)
	it can have a much greater chance of success
	   if the noble has been working for you for a while

Let's come back to that.

If the faction tag on units is hidden, then there is a new dimension of
intrigue.  The owner of the unit gets the report of everything it sees
and does.  The noble who hired the unit, however, does not.  Perhaps that
sea-captain you hired is really in the employ of your sworn enemy?


autotrain <list>		Train men if possible.
autohonor <amount>		Honor self with the given amount of gold
				each month.  If amount is "all", the noble
				will spend all of its gold on itself.
				autohonor 0 turns off automatic honoring.
				autohonor work applies same amount PAYed each
				month to honor


Program for unsworn units (independents, or "indeps"):

	Upon leaving service of their owner, indeps do:

		HONOR <all gold in inventory>
		AUTOHONOR HIRE
		WORK 50 + maint cost

Osswid [5499], hire for 50 gold, shipwright, sailor, fisher,
builder, mercenary

TELL GIVE won't give up items the hireling had when he began
working for the noble. (not good enough; noble might still use the item)


Faerie project:
    1.	Instead of doing NSEW by the numbers, instead make a [4] vector
	for each province location.  Must adjust dir.c, mapgen.  Can
	eliminate the init_prov_dest junk.

    2.  Generate a 5x5 or 10x10 set of locations for Faerie.  Wrap the
	edges.  Must fit into region called Faerie.  All forest locs.
	But no harvesting allowed.  Or enchanted forest locs.

	Instead of wrapping edges, line with water locations.  Mwah ha ha.
	They can't make ships in Faerie.  Ha ha ha!

    3.	Seed with a Faerie hill in each location.

    4.  Faerie hills exist both in Faerie as well as somewhere in the
        real world, from time to time.  Faerie stone can summon them.
	(Once a year they appear).

    5.  Faerie cities sell rare, nifty things.

    6.  Faerie has the Elven Hunt who attacks anyone they see, except
	those who possess a faerie stone.

    7.  No building in Faerie.

    8.  Save faerie region in system file.  If region(where) == reg_faerie
		if (in_faerie(where/who))


Hades project:

Perf:
  Hash subkinds....have a lookup_subkind?
  Wonder what the perf improve would be
  Or do a bsearch...  or simply save the number -- that's an easy time test
  How about munch first two letters of the major kind, and have a quickie
  routine to return the T_kind?

Spirit World
------------

New magical skill category allows one's spirit to leave the body
and travel in the spirit world.

	o  use to cause spirit to appear next to body (stacked with?)

	o  use to capture a demon

	o  links from all graveyards to Hades

	o  Hades is maze-like, with various demons about




	-  Harmful to the body -- incurs health loss

	-  Spirit is a separate entity one may give special orders to.

		RETURN causes the spirit to cease existing, and returns
		control to the living body.

		The noble is inactive while the spirit exists.

	-  Spirit-on-death bit.  When one dies, one becomes a spirit
	   in Hades.

	-  Spirits can't pick up things

	-  Spirits only know spirit magic that they took with them.
	   If they learn more in the spirit realm, they bring the
	   knowledge back with them.

	-  Perhaps living can somehow get into realm-land.

	-  Spirits go to Hades, capture some demons, and bring them
	   back to the real world to fight

Inns require ale, pipeweed to be operated

	o  After location report, give to owner the inventory report
	   for the inn:

		Inn stores:

			55 ale [nn]
			12 pipeweed [xxx]

	o  Each man who enters deducts one ale, one pipeweed
	o  Random additional depletion
	o  Zero amount causes random amount of destruction
	   from brawlers

	o  Double healing
	o  No thieving

o Osswid the Constructor [501], with:
    The Townsmen, 14 peasants
    The Guard, 5 soldiers
  - Feasel the Wicked [502], with:
      Rowdies, 10 soldiers
  - Kosar [505], with:
      1 peasant

The idea here is that there is a name string associated with each type
of unit.  If a unit of that type exists and a name exists, it is
displayed.  In the above example, "The Townsmen", "The Guard", and
"Rowdies" are names set by the player.  The one peasant hasn't had a
name set yet.  This would allow for a little more personalization of
units with a minimum of coding.  I suspect that "a lack of
personality" will be one of the primary complaints you will get about
the men-as-inventory and this should -- at least cosmetically -- be a
reasonable response to such complaints.  You did say you wanted a
"role-playing" feel.
