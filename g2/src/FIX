Since it has been a long time since I'd looked at the source, and since
I stumbled across that weirdness with swampy combat, I decided to just
read through the sources to try and improve my overall feel for the
program.  Naturally, this is taking longer than I thought, plus the
recent need to actually do some work has slowed me down.  I've gotten
through about a third of it at this point, and thought I'd mention a
couple of things I've noted along the way.  A couple of these seem
to be real bugs; most of them are just things that struck me oddly.

	In combat.c, the "weather" determination is wrong.  It has:
		if (wind or rain) {
			archer, elite_archer  missile rating / 2
			crossbowman missile rating / 4
		}
		else if (fog) {
			all missile ratings / 4
		}

	If there is *both* fog and rain(wind), then only the lesser
	rain(wind) effects are charged, not the more stringent fog
	effects.  In particular note that if it is foggy, catapults
	and dragons have their misile effectiveness cut to 1/4.  If
	it is both raining *and* foggy, then they are unaffected.
	I think you just want to test the fog first:
		if (fog) {
			all missile ratings / 4
		}
		else if (wind or rain) {
			archer, elite_archer  missile rating / 2  
			crossbowman missile rating / 4
		}


	In art.c - d_forge_art_x:  The 500 gold forging cost is
	charged twice.



	alchem.c - v_use_death:  does 50 point of damage, but rules
	say it should be instant death.

	alchem.c - v_use_slave: If the recieving faction does not
	have enough noble points, the unit deserts from the original
	faction anyway.

	alchem.c - d_lead_to_gold:  The farrenstone is consumed.  The
	rules say that it is a "catalyst".  I (and I think, most people)
	think of a "catalyst" as something needed for a reaction, but
	is not itself consumed by that reaction.  I freely admit that
	this is not necessarily true (catalysts can be consumed), but
	I think the wording in the rules is unnecessarily confusing.

	art.c - v_curse_noncreat, destroyable_item:  Only palantirs
	and auraculums can be cursed?  Not forged weapons/armor?
	This seems odd (why are palantirs singled out?).  One does
	need to be a little bit careful here so that forged things
	doen't get used as "aura batteries".  But limiting the
	amount of aura that can be put into the item in the first
	place, plus the time and aura cost of using the "destroy"
	spell would make that route unprofitable.

	breed.c :  the different horse types (riding/war/wild) are
	interchangeable for breeding, but different man types are not
	(must be "peasant", not worker, soldier, sailor, etc.)

	day.c, u.c: barking dogs - The rules say that dogs might bark
	if a concealed character is in the same "location".  The source
	seems to say that the concealed character must actually be in
	the same sub-location as the hound (e.g. actually inside the
	castle, not just in the same province as the castle).  I admit
	I am not 100% sure of this point.  If so, then hounds are
	fairly impotent; they should be given some chance of barking
	at a concealed character in the same sub-location *each* day,
	not just once a month.  If they in fact bark at any concealed
	character in the same province, then the once-a-month business
	seems ok.
