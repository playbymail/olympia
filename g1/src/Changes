The magical skills, with the exception of Basic magic, are harder to learn.
Weather magic may only be leared in the Cloudlands, a region which floats
over Mt. Olympus and the Imperial City, and which is accessible only by
flight.  Learning necromancy requires a trip to Hades, and Scrying is only
taught by the elves in Faery.  Some monsters guard ancient books which also
teach these skills.
