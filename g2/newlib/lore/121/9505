#Skill:  Fight to the death [9505]
Usage:   USE @@@@ <flag>
Time:    0 days

Knowledge of @@@@ allows a leader to inspire troops to fight past
their break point.  Such units will choose death instead of allowing
themselves to be taken prisoner.

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  When @@@@ is engaged, however, the troops
will fight to the last man.

Issue the order USE @@@@ 1 to cause troops to fight to the death.
The normal 50% break point may be restored with the order USE @@@@ 0.

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for @@@@ is checked.
@@@@ works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.
