<SPAN>
The <CODE>accept</CODE> order must be used in order to receive items 
from other players.
Gold is exempt from the ACCEPT check.
The effects of ACCEPT last until the end of the turn, then expire.
</SPAN><BR>
<P>
If ACCEPT is issued by a character, it applies to items given to
that character only.
If ACCEPT is issued by the player entity, it applies to every unit
in the faction.
</P>
<P>
If from-who is 0, the item will be accepted from anyone.
Otherwise from-who should specify a character or a faction.
If item is 0, any item will be accepted.
If qty is zero or is not present, any quantity of the item will
be accepted.
</P>
<P>
If qty is specified, the given quantity must be less than or equal
to the qty specified on the matching ACCEPT order.
If the GIVE is successful, the given quantity will be deduced from
the remaining qty value in the outstanding ACCEPT.
</P>
<P>
A GIVE which could be passed by multiple overlapping ACCEPT orders
will choose the first which matches, first for the character, then
for the player entity.
If an ACCEPT order specifies an item quantity limit, the quantity
must be greater than or equal to the amount specified in the GIVE
order.
Multiple conflicting ACCEPT orders will not combined to satisfy a
single GIVE.

yields 
  one wood [77] per day per worker, as long as the forest has a supply 
of wood. 
  <P>However, some tasks have an element of randomness. Horse-catching, 
for 
  example, is a difficult, uncertain task. Each day there is only a 50% 
chance 
  that a noble will catch a wild horse.</P>
  <P>The chance is for the unit as a whole, not for individual men 
engaged in 
  the task. Thus, a unit of sailors will collect fish about half of the 
days 
  they spend fishing. The other half, no fish will be caught.</P></DD>

<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Loot and 
pillage a 
province or city. If flag is not given, pillaging will not take place if 
the 
province is being protected by guards. If flag is 1, the looters will 
first 
attack the guards, then proceed with pillaging if the guards are 
defeated.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">At least 
10 
fighters must be in the pillaging stack. They may be soldiers, pikemen, 
nobles,

may 
initiate pillaging.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Pillaging 
will 
seize the available tax base, which otherwise would have gone to 
the 
location owner (if there is one).
</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Pillaging 
reduces 
the future tax base for a city or province. Locations take four 
months to 
recover from pillaging for each time they have been pillaged.
</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Pillaging 
can be 
dangerous. There is a 33% chance that a mob of 12-36 angry peasants will 
form to 
resist further pillaging attempts. Angry peasants have a combat rating 
of 
(attack-2, defense-1, missile-0). If a mob forms, there is a 33% chance 
that the 
mob will immediately attack the pillager in retaliation.

<HR>

<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Terror 
may be used 
to convert prisoners to a faction, or to reinforce fear loyalty among 
the

beneath the 
terrorizing unit.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">When used 
on one's 
own units,&nbsp;<CODE>terrorize</CODE>&nbsp;will establish or increase 
fear 
loyalty. Nobles of contract loyalty will be converted to fear. The 
severity 
amount will be added to the noble's fear rating. For instance, a fear-4 
noble 
terrorized at severity 10 will become fear-14.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">The 
severity 
indicates how much the noble will be abused to gain fear. The noble will 
suffer 
a&nbsp;<VAR>severity</VAR>&nbsp;hit to health as a result. Thus, there 
is a 
danger that the noble will fall ill with increasing amounts of 
terror.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Prisoners 
may also 
be terrorized. Prisoners of contract or fear loyalty lord 
have&nbsp;<VAR>severity</VAR>&nbsp;percent chance of swearing fealty to 
the 
terrorizing unit. Oathbound units can not be induced to convert through 
terror.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Thus, the 
more 
severe the terrorization, the greater the chance that a prisoner will 
swear to 
the terrorizer, but also the greater the victim's wounds. Prisoners have 
been 
known to die as a result of over-zealous conversion attempts.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE:

belonging to other player factions may not be terrorized unless they are 
being 
held prisoner.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Units of 
fear 
loyalty may not use the&nbsp;<CODE>terrorize</CODE>&nbsp;order.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">To avoid 
a newly 
terrorized unit to immediately renounce loyalty at the end of the turn, 
if a 
severity is not provided when terrorizing, it defaults to 3. &nbsp;This 
buys you 
one turn to get it right.

<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Wait for

<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">The

<DL style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">

  <DD>Wait until it is not foggy, windy or rainy.</DD>
  <DT><EM>day&nbsp;<VAR>n</VAR></EM></DT>

  <P>Units waiting to&nbsp;<CODE>board</CODE>&nbsp;a ferry should 
  use&nbsp;<CODE>wait ferry</CODE>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<CODE>wait 
ship</CODE>. 
  This will allow passengers on the ship time to disembark. When 
passenger 
  unloaded is complete, the captain will sound the ship's horn, and 
those 
  wishing to&nbsp;<CODE>board</CODE>&nbsp;may proceed.</P>
  <P>Otherwise, those waiting to board may try to get on the ship before 
the 
  current load of passengers has left, 
  causing&nbsp;<CODE>board</CODE>&nbsp;orders to fail because of ship

  <DD>Wait until it is raining in the noble's province.</DD>
  <DT><EM>ship&nbsp;<VAR>n</VAR></EM></DT>
  <DD>Wait until the specified ship arrives in port.</DD>
  <DT><EM>shiploc&nbsp;<VAR>n</VAR></EM></DT>
  <DD>Many players have been bitten by using&nbsp;<CODE>wait 
  loc</CODE>&nbsp;while they're on a ship to wait for the ship's arrival 
at a 
  particular port. Don't do this!&nbsp;<CODE>wait loc</CODE>&nbsp;waits 
for the 
  noble to arrive at a particular location. If the noble is on a 
  ship,&nbsp;<EM>the ship</EM>&nbsp;is the location the noble is in, not 
the 
  ship's location. 
  <P>Use&nbsp;<CODE>wait shiploc</CODE>&nbsp;to wait for the ship's 
arrival at a 
  particular place.</P></DD>
  <DT><EM>stack&nbsp;<VAR>n</VAR></EM></DT>
  <DD>Wait until the character and unit&nbsp;<VAR>n</VAR>&nbsp;are 
members of 
  the same stack. Position within the stack is not important; The 
condition is 
  true whenever&nbsp;<VAR>n</VAR>&nbsp;and the character share a common

<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">For 
example:</P>
<DL style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">
  <DD><PRE>1: &gt; wait time 1
1: Wait finished: one day has passed.
2: &gt; wait time 10 day 5
5: Wait finished: today is day 5.
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">The first 
condition 
to become true will end the wait. This can be used to specify the 
maximum amount 
of time that the character will wait for something.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">For 
instance, 
suppose we want to wait for [5499] to show up, but we don't want to wait 
past 
day 15.</P>
<DL style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">
  <DD><PRE>&gt; wait unit 5499 day 15
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">This 
order will 
finish on day 15 or as soon as 5499 shows up, which ever comes first. If 
5499 is 
already here when the order is issued, no wait will take place. 
Likewise, if it 
is already past day 15, no wait will take place.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Keep in 
mind that 
the order priority mechanism eliminates the need to use waits in many 
cases. 
Consider synchronization in the following example:</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Feasel 
[502] 
arrives at Osswid's [5499] location. Feasel gives Osswid some gold, and 
then 
leaves. Osswid departs after receiving the gold.</P>
<DL style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">
  <DD><PRE>unit 502   # Feasel
  move ...
  pay 5499 100
  move ...

unit 5499  # Osswid
  wait unit 502
  move ...
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">The 
orders above 
will work; no additional waits are needed. After the&nbsp;<CODE>wait 
unit</CODE>&nbsp;becomes true, both 502's&nbsp;<CODE>pay</CODE>&nbsp;and 

5499's&nbsp;<CODE>move</CODE>&nbsp;are ready to execute. 
Since&nbsp;<CODE>pay</CODE>&nbsp;has a lower priority 
than&nbsp;<CODE>move</CODE>,&nbsp;<CODE>pay</CODE>&nbsp;will happen 
first.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">This 
technique also 
works with&nbsp;<CODE>stack</CODE>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<CODE>give</CODE>, 
since they 
also have a lower priority than&nbsp;<CODE>move</CODE>.</P>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">The NOT 
keyword 
inverts the sense of the condition which follows. For example:</P>
<DL style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">
  <DD><PRE>&gt; wait not rain time 7
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Will wait 
until it 
is not raining, or for seven days, whichever comes first.</P>
<DL style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">
  <DD><PRE>&gt; wait not rain not wind
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: medium">Will wait 
until it 
is not raining or not windy.
