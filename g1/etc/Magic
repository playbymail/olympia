Magic in Olympia is hard to learn, and hard to use.

	"Magic is a dead cat in an oil-stained burlap bag.
	 Magic is a smelly old man, despised but feared by his neighbors.
	 Magic is what the king turns to, when his soldiers fail."

		-- a long-dead wise man of Areth Pirn


Magic is not Superman cutting down his foes with directed energy beams.
It is not Rambo blasting enemy hordes with fireballs.
