Harvest lumber [702]
--------------------
Usage:     WOOD [number] [days]
Time:      as given or necessary
Requires:  at least one worker [11]

Workers enter the forest and select trees which are suitable for felling
and sawing.  Lumber is used in the construction of ships, buildings and
some weapons.  Timber is also used to support the roofs of mine shafts.

Must be used in a forest province.  Forests generate 30 wood [77] each
month.

Examples:

    wood         # obtain as much wood as possible
    wood 25      # stop after getting 25 wood
    wood 0 5     # cut timber for five days
    wood 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 wood, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, timber cutting will cease as soon as the forest's supply
of wood for the month has been exhausted.

WOOD is an alias for COLLECT 77.


Reveal abilities of another mage [805]
--------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 805 <target> <magical skill category> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points of aura, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Used against another magician, this spell will attempt to
reveal all spells known by the other mage within the given
magical skill category.

If the target is shrouding his abilities, the aura invested in
USE 805 must exceed the shroud's aura, or the spell will fail.
For instance, USE 805 4 (costing four aura points) is required 
to overcome a three-aura ability shroud.
