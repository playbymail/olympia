Train wild horse to riding horse [656]
--------------------------------------
Usage:     MAKE 52

Requires:  one wild horse [51]
Produces:  one riding horse [52]

Time:      three days

Wild horses are first broken to saddle, then trained to respect
and obey whatever riders they may serve.  Once broken, riding
horses become too timid and docile to be of any use in battle.


Appear common [803]
-------------------
Usage:  USE 803 <aura>

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The caster expends aura to conceal the fact that he is a magician.
Nobles who possess magical powers are identified to others in the turn
reports with a tag:

        max aura        tag
        --------        ---
          5-10          mage
         11-16          wizard
          17+           sorcerer

Use of 803 allows the tag to be suppressed for a number of turns
equal to the amount of aura invested in the cast.

Uses of 803 are addititive.  A mage with 4 turns of concealment
remaining who ordered "use 803 3" would have a total of seven turns
of concealment.
