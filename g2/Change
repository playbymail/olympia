1.	Reconsider holes in the map.  Confusing for players.
	Even hidden squares have them confused.  Perhaps all of the
	square provinces should be sane, but the inner locs could
	sit on the corners or something.

	low-pri

2.	Give initial players 20 NP's to start.  Forming a noble always
	costs 1 NP.  Make a command to reclaim a noble and get the NP
	back.  Give 1 NP to each faction every eight turns.  No progressive
	NP requirement for nobles.

3.	City founding now requires that a castle NOT be present in the
	location.  This is undocumented.  The whole castle-in-region
	thing plus the tax base issue needs to be reworked.

3a.	Remove the quirks from the city/province tax base rules.
	Cities and provinces would yield an equal amount of tax
	or pillage gold.  A castle in a province would not inhibit
	city founding in that province (although perhaps the founders
	should be required to be the owners of the castle.)

4.	Mine depth thing is a bit strange.  Rework it.
	Perhaps there should be an indication of how much material
	there is.  Or you should just get everything as it appears,
	or something.

	mine bug:  must do a touch_loc
	also it sounds like the mine isn't being initially seeded
	with minerals, until the turn after it's created.


5.	Skill experience -- eliminate?  Or make it work more reliably.

6.	It's too hard to make castles.

	Perhaps there should be an upgradable progression.

		fortress stronghold (thes)
		castle
		citadel

		castle-1  castle-2  castle-3

7.	Look into pillage formula.  Make taxing a bit more attractive.

8.	Consider alternate DWIM approaches for order execution.

	Estimate time order will take, allow stack members to finish
	zero-time orders before beginning time-taking orders.


9.	Make travel times longer.

		No route should be less than 10 days (?)
		Lengthen sea routes
		Perhaps horses give a 25% bonus?
