Here comes the first part of the religion stuff.  Obviously this is a
first draft, comments will be appreciated.

			        RELIGION
	
BASIC ELEMENTS

  The basic elements of the Olympia religion system are Priests, Prayers
  and Temples.  Priests are noble units dedicated to a particular
  religion, Prayers are the priestly equivalent of spells, and Temples are
  structures dedicated to a particular religion.

PRIESTS

  * A noble unit becomes a Priest by travelling to a Temple of the
  religion he'd like to join, and then using the JOIN command.
  Becoming a Priest requires the unit to make an appropriate
  sacrifice, usually a fair amount of gold (how much?) but in the case
  of some of the darker religions, a corpse is also suitable.
  
  * A stack with a Priest in it gets certain advantages and
  disadvantages: 

  Advantages

    * +5% "to-hit" bonus in battle against other religions and magicians.
    * +5% "saving throw" versus magic spells. 
    * Can recruit better (+10%) in regions which contain a temple of the 
      appropriate type.
    * Priests can immediately identify Magicians.  Experienced Priests
      can identify the Magician's school.
    * Can enter temples of own religion.

  Disadvantages

    * Small minuses (-5%) in battle against members of same religion.
    * Difficulty recruiting in regions which contain another religion's
      temple or a wizard's tower (-20%).
    * Can *never* stack with Magicians or Priests of another religion.
    * Magicians can immediately identify Priests.  Experienced Magicians
      can identify the Priest's religion.

  * Priests have a "Piety" rating.  Piety, like aura, is used to fuel 
  Prayers.  Unlike aura, Priests know neither their maximum nor current 
  Piety.  Piety can be increased by:

    * Using the Prayer "PRAY".
    * Using the Prayer "PROSLETISE"
    * Sacrificing to a temple (via GIVE): gold, artifacts, wizards...
    * Spending time in a Temple.
    * Creating a new Temple.
    * Destroying a Magician's tower.
    
  Piety can be lost by:

    * Casting prayers.
    * Removing items from the Temple treasury. (Lose 2x what you would
      have gotten by sacrificing the same item.)
      
  * High Priests - If a priest unit has 20% higher maximum piety than
  every other priest of the same religion, then his god recognizes him
  as "High Priest" and he immediately gains +5 piety.  High Priests
  are known to everyone, i.e., published in the Times, and the
  location of the High Priest is revealed each turn to all the priests
  of the religion each turn.  Note that High Priest can change hands
  as priests' maximum piety changes; it is not a permanent position.
      
TEMPLES

    * Temples are building structures dedicated (by use of a high-level 
    Prayer) to a particular god.

    * Temples are protected by a magical barrier that can only be passed
    by stacks containing an appropriate Priest.  (Note: Magicians can 
    dispell this barrier w/ [9161].)

    * Temples can be "hidden", making them secret sublocations.

    * All temples contain a Holy Book which holds Prayers of that
    religion.  Holy Books are magically created during the dedication
    of the Temple and start out with Pray, Heal, and Bless.  Other
    Prayers can be added by use of the "Holy Script" prayer.  Prayers
    can be learned out of Holy Books.  A Holy Book cannot be removed
    from its temple, but they can be held by a Priest in the temple.
    (Note: If a Magician destroys the magical barrier on a temple, he
    could go in an retrieve the book.  There should be some high-level
    Magicians/Necromancer spells requiring a holy book.)

    The existence and use of Holy Books is not common knowledge.

    * Some temples have inner sanctums (hidden sublocs) that can only
    be entered by individual Priest units of high level.  Inner
    sanctums are created by having a Priest of current piety > 15 cast
    Dedicate Temple while inside a temple.  (This information is not
    initially available to the players.)  The inner sanctum will, like
    the Temple, have a Holy Book.  In the case of Inner Sanctums
    created by players, the Holy Book therein will have one random
    higher-level prayer inscribed.  In the case of Inner Sanctums
    created during world initialization, the Holy Books will have 1-3
    higher-level prayers.  Inner Sanctum Holy Books cannot be removed
    from the Inner Sanctum.  Only one Inner Sanctum can be created per
    Temple.

    Destroying the magical barrier on the outside of the temple
    destroys the Inner Sanctum and all it contains.  Units in the
    Inner Sanctum when this occurs will be booted out into the regular
    Temple area.

    * Healing at 3x in temples.

    * No combat in temples.

    * No maintenance costs inside a temple.

    * Non-Priest units can enter a temple only when stacked with a Priest.

    * Non-Priest units entering a temple pay a 10% tithe of their gold
    to the temple.

    * Non-Priest units cannot perform any actions which require time 
    while inside the Temple.  Non-Priest units in a Temple "work" for
    the Temple, adding any moneys they make to the Temple treasury.

    * Stacking within the Temple is ordered by current piety.  The most 
    currently pious unit in the temple is at the top of the heap and so
    on down the line.

    * The Temple treasury holds everything sacrificed at the temple
    (i.e., GIVEn to the temple) as well as the 10% tithes.  The Temple
    treasury is controlled by the currently most pious priest within the
    temple. 

PRAYER

This section contains prayers common to all the religions.  Notes on the
individual religions follow this section, but we note here that every

----------------

Prayer: Pray to Deity []
Usage: USE []
Required Item: none
Time to cast: 7 days

By use of this prayer, a Priest demonstrates his faith to his Deity.
Devotional prayer is the cornerstone of every religion.  By use of
devotional prayer a Priest gains holy power and in rare instances, the
direct guidance of his deity.

$$$

  Piety: 0

  Pray raises the current Piety of the praying Priest by one.  

  If the Priest is already at maximum piety and has maximum piety < 25, 
  there is a 
        .004 chance that his maximum piety will be raised by 1.
	.001 chance that his diety will reveal a prayer to the Priest.

  If the Priest is at maximum piety and has maximum piety > 25, then 
  there is a 
  
        .004 chance that his diety will reveal a prayer,
	.002 chance that his diety will grant the priest a holy artifact.
	     (But a priest will only be granted one holy artifact, ever.)

----------------

Prayer: Bless
Usage: USE [] <unit>
Required Item: none
Time to cast: 1 day

This prayer calls a blessing down upon the designated unit.  This
blessing will help shield the unit in battle and improve the unit's
resistance to magics.  This effect lasts 7 days.

Priests cannot bless Magicians or Priests of another religion.

$$$

Piety: 1

Bless gives a 5% bonus to defense and a 5% bonus against magic.  Bless
will also fail if the blessed unit is carrying a holy artifact of a
different religion.

May also be cast upon buildings (+5% to defensive strength) and items
(effect?).  This is not initially known to the players.

----------------

Prayer: Heal
Usage: USE [] <unit>
Required Item: holy plant
Time to cast: 1 day

This prayer causes the designated unit to be miraculously healed.  

$$$

Piety: 3

Should be more powerful than the Magician equivalent.  Perhaps heal any
one unit to full health?

----------------

Prayer: Create Holy Symbol
Usage: USE []
Required Item: one unit silver
Time to cast: 30 days

Create a holy symbol [] consecrated to the Priest unit's diety.  The holy
symbol increases the faith of the Priest and is necessary for many
prayers.

$$$
Piety: 3 (permanent)

This prayer creates a new holy symbol at a permanent cost of 3 points. 
A holy symbol consecrated to the proper diety and carried raises a
Priest's maximum piety by 5 points.  Notes: (1) it is perfectly possible
for a Priest to find a holy symbol or obtain one from another Priest,
thereby avoiding spending the 3 piety to create one.  (2) There is
nothing to distinguish one holy symbol from another.  Carrying a holy
symbol consecrated to the wrong deity costs the Priest -10 piety.  (3)
Carrying multiple holy symbols has no additional effect.  (But if a unit
carries the wrong symbol and a right one, the wrong one has effect.)

----------------

Prayer: Turn Undead
Usage: USE [] <unit>
Required Item: holy symbol
Time to cast: 1 day

By use of this prayer, the Priest will strike fear into the undead
legions commanded by the designated unit.  The affected undead will flee
the province in a random direction.

$$$

Piety: 3

A number of undead equal to the Priest's current piety flee the
province, or half that number of skeleton warriors, or one third that
number of undead followers.  If the designated unit commands a mixed
force of undead, then undead flee first, followed by skeleton warriors,
followed by undead followers.

Should be a Necromancy spell to guard against this prayer.

----------------

Prayer: Destroy Undead
Usage: USE [] <unit>
Required Item: holy symbol
Time to cast: 1 day

By use of this prayer, the Priest will destroy the undead legions
commanded by the designated unit.

$$$

Piety: 5

A number of undead equal to the Priest's current piety are destroyed, or
half that number of skeleton warriors, or one third that number of
undead followers.  If the designated unit commands a mixed force of
undead, then undead are destroyed first, followed by skeleton warriors,
followed by undead followers. 

Should be a Necromancy spell to guard against this spell.

----------------

Prayer: Last Rites
Usage: USE [] <unit>
Required Item: holy symbol
Time to cast: 1 day

Commend a dead noble to his final resting place.  This prayer prevents
the noble from ever being raised as undead.

$$$
Piety : 1
----------------

Prayer: Holy Runes
Usage: USE [] <prayer> <entity>
Required Item: none
Time to cast: 1 day

Permits a Priest to read or write a prayer into a Holy Book or appropriate
scroll.  

$$$
Piety: <variable>

To write a prayer into a Holy Book, you must expend twice the piety
required to cast the spell.  Note that you can neither read nor write
in Holy Books or scrolls of a different religion.

----------------

Prayer: Conceal Aura
Usage: USE [] <unit>
Required Item: none
Time to cast: 1 day

Conceal the aura of the designated unit for one month.  The unit's aura
will appear grey (unaligned).

$$$
Piety: 3

The aura is how Magicians/Priests detect one another.  The color of the
aura indicates the school/religion.  (We'll have to decide on an
appropriate assignment of colors.)  Non-magic units have grey auras.
----------------

Prayer: Proselytise
Usage: USE [] <number>
Required Item: none
Time to cast: 7 days

Attempt to raise followers from amongst the peasantry.  Priests do not
have to pay recruitment costs for followers gathered through
Proselytise.  Note that Proselytizing works best where there is
already support for a deity.

$$$
Piety: 5

Proselytise works as well as normal recruitment in provinces with an
appropriate temple; half as well in unaligned provinces; and not at all
in provinces with a wizard's tower or other temple.

----------------

Prayer: Dedicate Temple
Usage: USE [] <building>
Required Item: holy symbol, holy plant, $500
Time to cast: 30 days

By use of this lengthy and costly ritual, the Priest consecrates a new
temple to his religion.  It is very dangerous to attempt to consecrate
a building that has been previously consecrated or used for magic.
For this reason, temples are almost always consecrated from
newly-constructed buildings.

If this prayer is interrupted by battle, the Priest will almost surely
die as a result.

$$$
Piety: 10

The Priest's maximum piety is raised by +5 for dedicating a new temple.

Consecrating a previously-consecrated or magician's building will fail
and cause the Priest to lose 10 piety (on top of the 10 spent in the
prayer).  If the consecration is interrupted by battle, the Priest
will lose (30-number of days spent)/3 piety (i.e., 0-10 piety
depending upon when interrupted).  In either case, if the Priest's
piety becomes negative, he dies immediately.  If his piety falls to 0,
he loses his Priest status.

----------------

Prayer: Holy Messenger
Usage: USE [] <destination> <item> <number>
Required Item: holy symbol
Time to cast: 7 days

By use of this prayer the priest summons a totem animal of his religion
to act as a messenger.  If possible, the messenger will carry the
indicated number of the given item to the indicated destination.  The
destination can be a location or a unit.

The holy messenger will only carry as much as it is able.  The Priest's
diety will direct the holy messenger towards its destination, but the
messenger may get lost or killed en route, in which case the items it
carries will also be lost (or taken by the attacking unit).  Holy
messengers are most likely to be able to find locations containing
temples or other priest units.

$$$
Piety: 5

Should adjust the animals so that religions whose totems cannot cross
water are compensated by greater carry capacity.

----------------

Prayer: Holy Warrior
Usage: USE [] <unit>
Required Item: holy symbol
Time to cast: 7 days

By means of this prayer, a priest summons a totem animal of his religion
and directs it to attack a nearby unit.  The unit need not be in the
same province as the summoning priest, but if it is too far distant the
Holy Warrior may get lost en route.

$$$
Piety: 7
----------------

Prayer: Holy Guard
Usage: USE [] <item or unit>
Required Item: holy symbol
Time to cast: 7 days

By means of this prayer, a priest summons a totem animal of his religion
and directs it to guard an item or unit.  The item or unit must be in
the same province as the summoning priest.  

$$$
Piety: 10

Here are the writeups on the 8 different religions.  Warning: this is
pretty long.

                            THE FAITHFUL EIGHT
			    
GENERAL NOTES

There are eight religions in Olympia, corresponding to the eight sons of
Sol that remained faithful during the Rebellion (see Mythology).  Each
religion has a particular area of strength, an area of weakness, a holy
plant and totem animal, and a mystic color.  The religions are grouped
in pairs, so that the strength of one religion is the weakness of its
paired religion.  Each area of strength corresponds to an Olympia skill
category.  This information is summarized below:

  God     Strength    Weakness    Plant         Animal      Color   Terrain
  ---     --------    --------    -----         ------      -----   -------
  Eres    Shipcraft   Mining      Gold Seagrass Shark       Blue    Coastal
  Anteus  Mining      Shipcraft   Firewort      Mole        Brown   Mountain
  Dol     Beasts      Alchemy     Beastnip      Bull        Red     Plains
  Timeid  Alchemy     Beasts      Green Rose    Eagle       Green   Woods
  Ham     Entertain   Construct   Elf Poppy     Monkey      Gold    City
	  Observation
  Kireus  Construct   Entertain   Ironwood      Horse       Granite City
		      Observation
  Halon   Leadership  Stealth     King's Fern   Lion        Silver  City
	  Persuasion
  Domingo Stealth     Leadership  Moon Palm     Rat	    Shadows City
		      Persuasion

In general, a priest learns his strength skill at 2x normal speed, and
cannot learn his weakness skill at all.  (A priest loses all weakness
skills when he JOINs his temple.)  Units stacked with a priest unit get
a 5% bonus using skills in the Priest's strength, and a -10% bonus using
skills in the Priest's weakness area.

The holy plants are all rare and difficult to find.  They are used as
components in many prayers.  They will typically be found in bunches
of 3-7 plants.  Except for "city", they are twice as likely to be
found in the indicated terrain.  (The four city religions get no bonus
for finding their holy plant in any terrain.)

In battle, a priest and the units stacked with him get +5% defensive
strength if they are fighting in the Priest's terrain.

=====

ERES

Eres is the God of Sea and Wind.  He appears to his followers as a tall,
strongly built man of advancing years, with a wild mane of white hair. 
Priests of Eres typically build their temples near the sea and often
serve on sailing ships.  It is said that a ship with a Priest of Eres on
it will never capsize or be lost in a storm.  Certainly it is true that
Priests of Eres have saved many a ship with their powerful prayers to
control the weather.

$$$

Temples to Eres must be in coastal provinces.  Attempts to consecrate
temples elsewhere will fail, with the usual disastrous results to the
consecrating Priest.

Ships with a Priest of Eres on board have a 10% bonus to avoid storm
damage.  This bonus is cumulative, so that a ship with 10 priests on
board would be completely immune to storm effects.  There is a similar
5% bonus to avoid being becalmed.

Spells

	(Same as weather magic:)

	Summon fog [9132]
	Summon rain [9135]
	Summon wind [9136]
	Predict future weather [9133]
	Project next weather spell [9138]
	Reveal source of last month's weather [9139]
	Conceal source of weather influence [9140]
	Fog of death [9134]

	(Other:)

        Summon Water Elemental (7)

Prayer: Summon Water Elemental 
Usage: USE [] 
Required Item: holy symbol, holy plant
Time to cast: 1 day

This spell summons a water elemental into the sea province the priest
occupies.  The water elemental will attempt to capsize the next ship
entering the province.

$$$
Piety: 7

The ship has a chance equal to a bad storm of being capsized by the
water elemental.  Magic may affect this chance.  A ship with a priest
of Eres on board will not be attacked.

=====

ANTEUS

Anteus is the God of Fire and Earth.  He appears to his followers as a
short, stout man with a bulbous nose, a long cap and he is often seen
carrying a pickaxe or hammer.  Priests of Anteus build their temples in
the mountains and are often seen working with miners.  It is said that
dwarves are the special minions of Anteus, and that a party which
contains a Priest of Anteus will never be attacked by dwarves and will
have free passage through dwarven tunnels. 

$$$

Temples to Anteus must be in mountain provinces.  Attempts to consecrate
temples elsewhere will fail, with the usual disastrous results to the
consecrating Priest. 

Dwarves will not attack stacks containing Priests of Anteus.  Stacks
containing Priests of Anteus may pass through protected routes that lead
into dwarven areas without knowing the pass key.  

Priests of Anteus lose 5 piety for attacking dwarves.

DOMINGO

Of all the Faithful Eight, least is known about Domingo.  The ancient
texts from the time of the Rebellion do not mention him, and there is
no record of his typical appearance.  Some say that he is one of the
children of Sol who followed Loki, returned now to Olympia to spy upon
the man and the Faithful.  Because of this, Priests of Domingo build
their temples in secret places and are cautious about announcing their
faith.  It is said that the priests of Domingo know all the secret
places in the world.

Temples to Domingo must be in a hidden location.  Attempts to
consecrate temples elsewhere will fail, with the usual disastrous
results.

stack as if he really belonged to <faction>, and might even end up in
control of a stack!

GIVE ninjas to an unsuspecting unit who will never know he has them.
