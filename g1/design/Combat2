Must analyze number of archers who can kill each kind of man



Fight:  if (rnd(1, a_blade + b_blade) <= a_blade)
                b dies;

Missile:  if (rnd(1, 100) <= accur && rnd(1,100) >= m-arm)
                target dies;


Chance that unit is taken prisoner:

        1:1     0%
        2:1     50%
        3:1     100%            (50 * n) / d - 50


Putting it all together:

        1.  Suppose we run combat until one side has >= 50% losses.
            We declare that side the loser and give the winner
            a "free shot".


        2.  Count units as ordinary fighters, except:
                each hit does rnd(10,20) health loss
                        (count towards losses for 50% somehow?)

                nobles have (80,0,80)
                        Archery (n, 50+lev*10, n)
                        Swordplay (n+(lev+1)*10, ...)
                        Critical hit (instant death, chance ...)

                if unit leader killed?
                        men break and run
                        men move to another unit
                        men remain fighting where they are until the end

        3.  Attacks against monsters
                no-prisoners a must for some


                Dragon [px78], (150, 0, 85)



        - crossbowman
peasant - soldier       - swordsman     - knight        - elite guard
                        - archer




Recall that men-as-inventory have no possessions or skills, but come in
various flavors:

        slave  peasant  soldier  knight  archer  crossbowman  swordsman

The knight is assumed to have a sword and be on a horse.  The archer
has a bow.  The slave has nothing, maybe a pitchfork or a stick.

Each are rated on three factors:

        fight -         Melee, hand-to-hand, swordplay ability.
                        Also the ability to defend against a close attack

        missile -       How often an archer hits his target.

        armor -         How often armor deflects a missile attack.

For a fight-fight encounter, the chance is proportional to the compared
fight ratings:

        a(fight=60) vs b(fight=30)      a has a 2/3 chance of killing b
        a(fight=60) vs b(fight=60)      a has a 1/2 chance of killing b

For a missile attack, first we see how many arrows are launched, then
how many hit.  A hit kills the target.

Assuming these three factors are a reasonable set to base combat on,
we must choose the vectors for the different kinds of men.

                  (blade, missile, armor)
                +------------------------
        slave   |    1      0        0
        peasant |    1      0        0
        soldier |    4      0       30%
        knight  |    7      0       60%
        archer  |    1    50%       0

I figure a combat would go something like:

        Some initial bonus, perhaps one of:

                The better lead side gets a free missile attack
                The better lead side can go first

        Then the rounds:

                Each side fires their missiles
                blade engagement


ram - gate, walls
catapult - roof & crenelations, walls
siege tower - walls, crenelations

%s tries to flank %s, but fails.
%s flanks %s.  %s is attacking the rear units of %s!

%s holds back.

%s enters the fight.

n slaves have escaped!
%s has escaped          (5-10% each combat).
