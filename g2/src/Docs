Subject: Problem with accept order in G2, last turn
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Status: OR

Hi Rich,

I had a problem with the 'accept' order last turn, or at least
with the documentation of that order.  I tried to allow a
faction to give me anything, but all transfers were refused.

wg8, I believe, is the correct player entity.  What went wrong?

 0: Interrupt current order.

 1: > accept 0 xv6
 1: Refused two oxen from Tonka [3880].
 1: > wait item 78 1 day 5
 1: Refused ten stone from Tonka [3880].
 5: Wait finished: today is day 5.
 5: > move dg77



Also please note that the 'Train' order description on the
web page has old (G1) skill numbers in the table.

Thanks,
