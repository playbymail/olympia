Swordplay [616]
---------------
Usage:  USE 616
Time:   seven days

Use of 616 will cause the noble to spend time and effort practicing
swordplay, for use in personal combat.  Each seven-day use of 616
raises the noble's attack rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the time
the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and will
gain 10 points.

Knowledge of Swordplay also allows the noble to train swordsmen,
knights, and elite guards, via the TRAIN order.




Find market for tradegood [733]
-------------------------------
Usage:  USE 733 <tradegood>
Time:   14 days

Use of 733 will attempt to find a buyer for a rare
tradegood in the local city market.  The trader must
possess at least one of the tradegood that a buyer
is being sought for.

Markets to purchase rare tradegoods must be at least
8 provinces away from the market selling the rare
tradegood.  A city will purchase at most two rare
tradegoods.  For a given tradegood, there is a 50%
chance that a city will purchase it.

If successful, the city market will begin buying the
rare tradegood.  A trader can hope to earn 2000-3000
gold in profit if a full quantity of the tradegood
is transported between the originating and consuming
cities and sold.

When the tradegood ceases to be sold in the originating
city, the purchasing city will also remove the item from
its purchase list, thus making room for another tradegood
to be bought.

733 must be used in a city in part of the regular world
(not Hades, Faery, the Cloudlands, or Subworld.)


Tap health for aura [806]
-------------------------
Usage:  USE 806 <amount of aura>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

The mage will dip into his own health to generate current aura.
The health loss received is equal to five times the amount of
aura generated.

For example, USE 806 10 would generate 10 points of current aura,
and cause the mage to receive a 50 point wound.

Use of this spell is dangerous, as any wound runs the risk of
infection, and death could result.  See the section on Health
in the rules for more information about wounds and healing.
