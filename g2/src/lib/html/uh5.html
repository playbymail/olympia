Mining [720]
------------
Mining is the skill of sinking deep shafts into mountainous
provinces for the purpose of extracting valuable elements.
Mining skills require a mine shaft to be constructed first
with the BUILD MINE order.

The likelihood of death because of cave-ins or poisonous gases
seeping into the shafts tends to make mining dangerous work.

The following skills may be studied directly once Mining is known:
