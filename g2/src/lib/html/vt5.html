Catch wild horses [655]
-----------------------
Usage:  CATCH  [number of horses]  [days]
Time:   as given or necessary

Attempt to catch any wild horses found roaming the plains or pastures.
Each day the noble will have a 50% chance of catching a wild horse,
if any can be found.  Up to five horses may be caught per month in a
plains province or a pasture.

A unit must know the Catch wild horses [655] subskill of
Beastmastery [650] in order to catch horses.

Examples:

    catch        # catch as many horses as possible
    catch 1      # stop after catching 1 wild horse
    catch 0 10   # try to catch horses for 10 days
    catch 1 10   # stop after catching 1 wild horse, or 10 days, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, horse-catching ceases when no more horses can be found
roaming in the location.
