A GET ALL order and a GET EVERY order. And a GIVE ALL and GIVE EVERY 
order.  ALL means all animate and inanimate objects other than the
actual unit or garrison of 10 soldiers (or 10 peasants).  Every means 
every inanimate object in possession.

For example, I'm in the same location as my noble g2r.  I want to leave 
all my ITEMs and some of my troops.  Instead of imputting 100 lines of 
GIVE orders, I can
GIVE g2r EVERY
GIVE g2r 12 10
GIVE g2r 286 5
get g2r 77 75	[ie:  I am taking back the specific amount of wood I 
		wanted to keep, but all my iron, elfstone, pikes, etc
		are now in his possession.

You might also write into the code that Ungarrison automatically has the
garrison GIVE [the ungarrisoning unit's id code] ALL.

Just a thought

Rich,

Quick question after looking at the "Changes in Olympia G2" page. You give
the following list for places where skills are taught...

>5.Where skills are taught: 
> Combat, Construction, Stealth, and Magic are taught in all cities. 
>
> Beastmastery is taught in cities in plains provinces. 
> Mining is taught in cities in mountain provinces. 
> Forestry is taught in cities in forest provinces. 
> Shipcraft is taught in all port cities. 
>
> Persuasion is taught in 50% of all cities, except safe havens. 
>
> Gatecraft is taught only in safe havens. 
>
>Non safe haven cities each offer one of the following skills,chosen at random:
>Alchemy, Weather magic, Scrying, Artifact Construction, or Necromancy. 

You don't seem to mention where you can pick up the new "Trade" catagory
skill. Is this intentional?

...and of course the question I'm sure you hate by now, any idea on a
start date yet?

Alasdair.

Garrison reports

I've picked up garrisons along the way, but I don't know if the former 
owner stockpiled anything in them.  The current report looks like:

garr where  men cost  tax forw castle rulers
---- -----  --- ----  --- ---- ------ ------
fo2p  ah76   10   20   50    6   e56  w8l t0j

hl8f  ah80   10   20   50    6   e56  w8l t0j

ek2t  ai81   10   20   50    6   e56  w8l t0j
cf2y  aj80   10   20   50    6   e56  w8l t0j
jr2h  aj81   10   20   50    6   e56  w8l t0j
ee4e  aj82   10   20   50    6   e56  w8l t0j
es6v  aj85   10   20  200   36   e56  w8l t0j
bf5d  aj86   10   20  250   46   e56  w8l t0j
jg6b  aj89   10   20  200   36   e56  w8l t0j
eo9c  aj90   10   20  200   36   e56  w8l t0j
bo1g  aj91   10   20   50    6   e56  w8l t0j
ju6s  am86   10   10   50    8   u56  o1g
bg7f  am87   10   20  200   36   u56  o1g

I suggest another column called "pos" for possessions...if the garrison 
has none, it shows a "-"    If it has anything, it shows a "yes".  Then a 
NEW ORDER, the castle owner may issue a "SHOW" order 

Example:  Garrison bo1g and bg7f have "yes" under the Pos column, all 
other garrisons do not.

w8l could issue:
SHOW bo1g (taking 1 day) and get a report:
garrison bo1g in aj91 reports it possesses 27 wood [77] and 33 stone [52]
	(whatever the numbers are for those items, you get the point)

note that although t0j has access to the garrisons because w8l is pledged 
to him, only w8l, the owner of the castle the garrison belongs to, can
request a report.  

Likewise, o1g has access to the bo1g garrison because it is the same 
faction as w8l, but he can only issue SHOW orders for his own garrison.


Questions:

What is the forw column in the garrison report?

Next...Many moon ago, Walt and I killed a noble who belonged to (we 
believe) a player who dropped.  After the players' nobles "disappeared",
we exhumed a body.  Its the Oath-1 noble that we killed.
I don't KNOW for a fact who this guy is now oathed to.  I have to connect
up with someone who can determin this guy's "lord".  And I don't have the
skill to do whatever it takes to get this guy to switch allegiance to me.
My question is:
a)  If I unstack him, will he merely fade away as his former faction is
	(I presume) no longer in play?
b)  Will he by like a npc-noble and join my faction in gratitude (in 
	which case I have wasted a _lot_ of time packing him around)?
			or
c)  The only way I can "convert" him is to get the skill required to do 
	it?

I am leaving off specifics because you really shouldn't tell me if this 
noble is "clanless" or not...if I asked that question, and you did not
answer it, I would have to presume you did not answer it because another
player owns it.  

Thanks for your time

Jim

(PS..its not _just_ the four noble points this guy accounts for, this guy 
is half-way decently skilled in skills I have a need for in a place where 
I can use him)

          Hi Rich,

          After thinking about the changes for a while, the only thing
          I have been able to come up with that may need adjustment is
          the building of castles. It appears from the changes you
          want to slow down the ramp up. For some reason I get an
          intuitive feel that castles should be harder to make (I
          never built one in g1 though), especially when compared to a
          tower.

I like most of your changes for g2, though I question why you have nobles
that surrender dropping a portion of their items?  if they Surrender they
can always do a manual drop if they want to get rid of something.

I especially like the increases in Archery/Defence/Swordplay.


Will mages who know Transcend Death, and characters with avoid fatal
blow lose from their defence when that skill is used?  Or just characters
who are resurrected?

I think garrisons should be forced to be ten fighters not just men the
same as the change in pillage rules.

In the castle table, is the stone and worker days for the next level a
cumulative total, or an additional amount needed?

Do cities add their 100 gold to the tax base in addition to their civilisation
level contribution?

It seems kind of strange that the more experienced magi need to do research
in cities.  Why not have something like, at most three researchable skills
in any category can be discovered outside of cities?
Or is that too complicated?

I'm also curious about Quest, do the monsters appear in the quest location
or does one travel from the quest location to somewhere else in order
to kill them?

Factions still gain NP over time I take it?  I read someone say something
that made me think otherwise but I can't find it in your posts anywhere.

No, I don't think it's very important.  I think that effectively in my
model everyone would end up wanting to build their castles in cities
anyway, precisely because that would give the most direct control over
the economic and military resources that the city provides.  Making it a
requirement wouldn't really make much difference at all, I think.

Most of my family is leaving this weekend, but I'm not leaving until

Sure.  The model in my head is that as you improve your castle, grow and
train your army, and perhaps "civilize" the surrounding countryside, you
could expand the area around your castle that you effectively "control."
What control means is that people in those areas consider you their
ruler, more or less.  You would get a certain amount of tax and tithe
income from provinces within your area of control; also the available
troops for your army would be limited to a fraction of the population
under your control (and you would have to pay them as well); you would
get reports on activities in such areas; you could employ the workforce
in such areas to exploit locally occurring natural resources; etc.

You could have a simpler or a more complex model.  A simple model would
perhaps be something like Oly g2 castle "levels": improving your castle
to the next level would increase the area around it that you could
control.  There could also be other necessary conditions: e.g., no
unfriendly forces in those areas, an army of a certain size and strength
to project power over such an area.

A more complex model might have "loyalty" ratings for individual
provinces: provinces nearer to your castle would have higher natural
loyalty; loyalty could be raised by investment in the province
infrastructure, giving out food and so forth, stationing troops to
impose martial law.  Loyalty would fall with unfavorable economic
events; excessive taxation; enemy action.  So your ability to draw
resources from the area would depend on your investment in its loyalty.
This would be a more complex economic game than the previous.

It seems to me you can have both.  You can try to develop a city into an
economic or military powerhouse, but you might be dependent on outside
sources of food and raw materials, or you could try to control a large
agrarian economy but you might be lacking in skilled tradesmen and the
like.  Also, all economies might depend to some extent on outside trade
(plains communities need metal from mountain mines, etc.).

I see castles (the player-controlled or npc-controlled pov's that
control territory) as independent from cities, as in Oly.  Although
there would be obvious advantages to putting your castle in a city.

I think of the game as initially starting with a small civilized area
and a large (infinite?) uncivilized wilderness which might not have any
cities.  In order to develop such a wilderness you would have to
civilize it (wipe out the "orcs"); then the human population
("citizens") would gradually grow and develop the land.

In my model there is an increasing difficulty of controlling a larger
and larger area from a single location/pov.  The effective maximum
radius depends on scale but perhaps a radius of 6 Oly provinces or so.

This all seems ok.  I'm not so worried about speed of movement in this
model, because most of your  power comes from your "castle", and that's
where most really significant combat will occur.  There won't be a whole
lot of maneuvering to intercept armies in the plains (which is good).

No time now to comment on the map stuff.  Later.

Some more "ideas":

Short of making garrisons invulnerable, if it took longer to eliminate
garrisons (instead of 21 days to install one and 1 day to wipe it out)
that would make castles worth more.

Garrisons should report on everything that happens in their provinces.
Perhaps also have a chance of detecting stealth nobles (can "hounds" be
installed in garrisons?).

I suppose one could try to defend one's garrisons by putting more,
better trained men in them.  But I think that's a losing battle.  It's
always going to be too easy to concentrate force and take them out one
by one.

Greetings,

I liked the balances/changes. I do have a few concerns:

*Immunity from Vision -- While this is a great idea, I think there is a
potential problem. 1) I don't think the user of this spell should
_always_ receive the identity of the priesty using Vision. Maybe a
precentage would be better? If the % fails, the IfV user would still
notice the point total is decreased, indicating someone is attempting a
vision. If the IfV user always receives the identity, using vision
against other priests would never occur, for fear of retribution.

2) There should probably be a maximum of points from IfV. Priests, like
mages with aura, don't need to be walking about with an IfV value of 100
(though this might be _very_ difficult, given the casting time).

*I didn't recognize any problems with the free first tower, though maybe
as GM you did. It helps to establish the noble, and allows research
immediately.

*Will roaming mobs still attack buildings? It was unclear -- you wrote
the game wouldn't attack a wandering noble. I'm thinking of mobs
damaging an unoccupied inn by attacking. This is a Good Thing, IMO, and
should remain.

Maybe more complicated in a coding sense, but often easier from the
design point of view than working out the correct constants once and
for all before starting the game.

On the breeding example, it would be too fiddly to change the time to
breed each species adaptively, but the 20% risk could easily be wobbled
up by, say, 0.01% for each breeding attempt, with the risks for all
species then reduced by an equal amount to bring the average back to
about 20%. The numbers could be published each turn or hidden according
to taste, but either would tend to lead to more mixed armies than the
constant numbers that inevitably get "solved".

The trade example is harder because of all the hyperspace options making
it hard to distinguish a long route from a short route. It may be that
trade would have a better feel if it was somehow encouraged or forced to
stay in the normal world rather than being another advantage of controlling
the weird places. Would it be good to populate Faerie and Hades with
mischievous leprechauns and imps that steal some proportion of trade
goods passing through? It might help preserve their fantasy feel rather
than making them commercial highways.

If you did that, it would be practical to relate trade good price
differentials to real-world distance, though proper floating markets
would be the only way to get perfect results...

I waited for all of you to finish speaking, such a polite boy I am.

1.  I do NOT want to see priest visions eliminated.  For 1 NP, what's
	the purpose of having one?  Ressurect Dead Nobles who come back
	at reduced strength?  Last Rites (new version, of course) to get
	the NPs back faster?  The Olympian Gods are not very powerful.
	Why cannot a Priest Bless a region like a Mage can do common

I concur that beast armies should be harder to expand than game 1.  I 
think the addition of lengthened breeding times does this.  So tell me,
how many turns will it be before someone can afford to try and CAPTURE
one?  Its going to take several turns to build up enough troops to try
and take on quest in the proper type of liar to get combat vs a dragon.
Assuming you capture 1, it will be 5 turns before you can try another
quest in the same location.  And then there's a % chance you get 
dragons.  So to capture 3 dragons, it will take, what, 75 turns?  That's
if there is only one type of sub-location where dragons can be found in
the area the player is working.  16 breeding attempts between then and
turn 100, with 5 failing, 5 causing the death of a breeder, all that
effort so by turn 100 you have 9 dragons....
unless you breed Giant Birds and Giant Lizards or whatever that combo is
to make dragons from lesser beasts...

Hard to say.

I would not play a closed-ended "victory is possible" Olympia.  I play 
these games to meet new people, explore, fight NPCs, and occasionally,
kick some deserving player's butt.  Let game 1 continue while game 2
goes on.  People who want more "bloodiness" can play game 1.  My only
concern is if g2 becomes too much a politically correct game...war is
unprofitable.  Also, without gatecraft, large armies will have a terrible 
time moving..6 days per hex for flying armies.  Hmm...ship travel just 
became faster.  Not as bad as I thought :)

I agree on beasts, my opinion is that dragons should cost peasants to
maintain ;-)  NPs work EXCEPT when players don't pass them on to other
players.  Is there a way to stop this without stopping honest
terrorization/eating of brains?

One problem is that movement will still slow human armies, especially since
it will take NP to move them.  Perhaps you should steal from Atlantis and
allow military units to be formed that will take movement, guard, and
attack orders.  But then all of a sudden turns get much longer to write.

I do think that random monsters should be out there.

Magic power isn't runaway.  I think that priest's visions should be
eliminated.  But I think that some form of saved speedcast should be
present, perhaps a single SC should be associated to a mage that knows Save
SC rather than making a potion.

Rich,

> Interesting idea.  Hmmm.  Thanks.

Well, if you're in the market for ideas, you could make nobles' attack and
defence levels meaningful enough to encourage people to raise them, eg:

Limit the number of men/beasts a noble can lead to their attack rating, and
relate the aura cost of blasting a character to their defence rating. (It
would be kinda neat to be able to build up a non-magical Conan to the point
where he can resist magical attacks.)

	The ACCEPT order is good but I think it could be a lot better
without too much work. The problem is that it still doesn't cover
ATTACKs and SURRENDERs which can dump tons of unwanted goods into your
inventory. Smart players will still find they need to do tons of drops
to get rid of things they never wanted.
	So...try any of these parameters for ACCEPT, and have the
implicit GIVEs done after ATTACKs and SURRENDERs go through the checks
as well. The special parameters should be cumulative with each other,
(ANDed together.) It's an issue whether you need to reset them every
turn or not.

	ACCEPT	<long integer>		# Accept as many of the offered

Yeah, it could be but it shouldn't be too bad if one-use.  But there

The advantage isn't *so* huge as to make restarts desirable.  And the
next turn, if more people enter, you'll just get pushed down again.
It would be pretty silly to keep restarting.

Not if you make the reduction to the maximum it isn't.  Is there
any way to raise your health over 100?  If not, lowering the 
maximum is a good penalty because it would be unrecoverable and
make the character more vulnerable to dying again.  Perhaps 10

I tried to reply to this yesterday but my provider seems to be sliding

Well, I'd make it a random range between, say, 2000 and 4000.  This
would give you more breathing room to quietly adjust things later
since changes would be less noticable than with a fixed value.  I
think you need to run a few sanity checks where you compare a bunch
of activities with respect to how much gold can be made in a given
time doing it moderately and optimally and shoot for balance.

Well, I'll trust that you've fixed the problem since I didn't deal
with beasts much beyond getting eliminated by the.  See Jeremy Maiden's
comments about simulating breeding scenarios.

You might want to ultimately increase it so that a single noble can
move more than 20 troops before there is a penalty but I think you are
better off starting with a lower number and raising it.  People will
complain less that way if changes are necessary.

Again, I'll trust you here.  My main concern is that a faction use it
as a quick way to jump around the world, unfairly cutting off people
who travelled there conventionally.  If you feel that's been addressed,
then that's fine.

OK.  This made me think about why I would have made such a suggestion.
I believe it had to do with allowing units trapped in IC ways to excape
(Stealth) and the ability to get a good start on other game activities
(Construction, etc.).  This is a little less necessary now that there
are 6 starting cities but I suppose the idea is still valid for safe
havens.

OK.  No problem.  

[Performing common tasks for gold]
>> I would again suggest not allowing this in safe havens.

>Why?

Because the new players wind up at the bottom of the execution queue
for the city and will never be able to use it if other players have a
lock on it for whatever reason.  We went over this with G1 when I
suggested adding new players to the top of the list when they start
the game.  Remember that being first matters quite a bit for a lot of
things and, in safe havens, there is no way to push someone off.
Similarly, this is a reason to reconsider buildings in a safe haven.
If someone accidentally leaves a tower, a person higher in the
location than they are can jump in and take it from them and there is
nothing that can be done about it, unlike anyplace else where
attacking is an option.  Again, I'd suggest placing new players at the
top of the list for safe locations to give them a jump on resources
such as peasants (can you recruit in safe havens?) because they need
it the most.  This also gives old players less incentive to stick
around and constantly be pushed down the list.  It will also give new
players a comodity to deal with when allying with older players (list
position).

Another artifact you might want is some sort of scepter that allows
the holder (and only the holder) to attack in safe-havens.  Since
there are six and I suspect that they are some distance apart, this
wouldn't shut out new players if a single city is dangerous.  It might
help shake things up if they get stagnant.  You'd just have to make
sure that the holder would have to walk from city to city and couldn't
jump around to all the save havens in a turn or two.  Perhaps an
automatic announcement in the safe havens of the artifact, it's holder,
and it's holder's location would help, too, when it is discovered.

>> I can see good reasons why a faction with no chance of recovering the

>Yes, that's why it's longer.

Then the player will undergo sufficient punishment for the death of an
unrecovered body and you should consider dropping the 1 NP penalty for
resurrections since (A) the player will already have wasted time and
effort on it and (B) the noble suffers some loses in the process.
BTW, I'd change the loss from Defense (recoverable via a skill) to
Health -- perhaps 20 or 25 points -- and consider the character as
having been wounded by the resurrection with respect to the healing or
dying check if that is still in there.  Make the reduced number the
new maximum.  This would give all nobles 4 or 5 resurrections before
they are dead-dead.  Perhaps an artifact could restore a noble's youth
once per game year or something.

[Restocking monsters]
>> I'd adjust the wait from 3-5 to 3-8 turns -- mabye longer.

My fear is that a player will be able to predict the restocking
and revisit a series of nearby lairs in sequence, constantly finding
something there.  Adjust accordingly.

Well, bear in mind that my original suggestions were made in the context
of a single starting city and one can change their mind.  :-)

In retrospect, there are reasons why I would have suggested
well-stocked safe havens -- specifically for later in the game when
all the surrounding areas will be well colonized.

Yes, but every little bit helps.

I disagree.  It makes it more important if you are in city X than city
Y if X teaches something that you want and Y doesn't.  If they are both
the same, they are interchangable.  Anything that makes it important 
that you be in a particular place adds flavor to the geography.

>To prevent powerful factions from hording lone cities which supply skills.

OK.  Here is a revised formula plus some reasoning where it differs
from your plan.

o  Every city teaches Combat (since you need combat to build troops)
   and Construction (needed to build towers and such -- how a city
   gets built up so it makes sense).

o  Each city teaches a regional skill (Beastmastery in plains and
   swamps [I suspect it will still be a much desired skill], Mining in
   mountains, Forestry in forests, and Trading in deserts [how do you
   think they maintain cities in the desert, huh? :->].  Any port
   city will also teach Shipcraft in addition to any regional skill
   indicated by the terrain outside of the city.  The six starting
   safe havens should be divided between all five terrains with the
   last city also being a forest city (basically, 2 Beastmastery, 
   1 Trading, 1 Mining, and 2 Forestry cities). 

o  Each city teaches a dark or subversive skill -- either Stealth
   (50%), Persuasion (45%), or Necromancy (5%).  Exactly which of these
   skills a city teaches will remain hidden until discovered by an
   EXPLORE that turns it up.  This will allow for quests to find
   Necromancy.  Safe havens will only have Stealth.  The idea is that
   the underground of each city operates by one of these means and
   you need to find it get get training in it.  Vary the percentages
   to suit your tastes.  

o  Each city will teach one magic skill -- Magic, Alchemy, Gatecraft,
   Weather Magic, Scrying, or Artifact Construction.  Since that is
   6 magics, you divide them between the six starting safe havens,
   one each, and then randomly everywhere else.  This will add some
   flavor the the starting selections.

Where this differs from your plan is that Shipcraft is an extra and
Forestry isn't guaranteed to starting players.  Magic is just another
Magic and players can pick which magic they might want to start with
by picking their starting city.  Finally, I think that obscuring Stealth,
Persuasion, and Necromancy might add some flavor and hint that these
are potentially troubling skills.  It makes people have to really work
to find them.

>> I can probably think up more if you think I'm on the right track.

>Some of these are cool, I will see what I have time to implement.

What other types of things are you looking for?  To use the board-game
_Cosmic Encounters_ as an example, special abilities are good if they
let you break or bend one game rule.  Alternately, they could provide
an easier to use version of an existing game item.  Keeping that in
mind, you should be able to think of quite a few of these things.

I wasn't a beast person so I'll trust that those who were will sanity
check this.

	After reading the WWW page, these issues still appear
unaddressed.

	1.  No 'hostile all' command. This combines with...
	2.  No check against anonymity privileges of newly
	    formed nobles and newly built structures.
	3.  Sublocations are still ATTACKable as structures.

	Barring exceptionally long order queues, a newly formed noble
can get up to 29 days of travel, fighting, etc. with no attacks made
against him.
	The newly built structure gives one turn's grace against any
attacker, so long as the builder starts day 1 with Construction and
enough wood or stone.
	IDEA: Have new nobles and structures appear on day 30 of
the month in which they are created. If a building noble doesn't
move all turn, he's placed inside the structure.
	The AOO are currently using item 3 to detect whenever any
sublocation in their vicinity becomes occupied and then immediately
attacking via a pre-queued HOSTILE order. I don't know if it works,
but they're trying. :-)

 Well, Beastmastery in combination with Questing and other strategies, I
still think that you need just a bit more for the NP to be worth it,
although that also depends on what a grandmaster gets as benefit... I

 The right place for this would be hard to find, but I can think of a few
on the old map that could have worked, assumming riding speed and garrison
access.  You could be right about 0-2, but don't forget that I'm mining
gold and items as well, at the cost of very replaceable soldiers.

 I was thinking of 50% success when I speced three locations/turn, I'd
like to see it be an effective month+ endeavor.  Another aspect to Quest,
is there any way to know that others have used the location lately?  Will
the order fail in 0 time, or is there a distinctive message, eg "Orc bones
litter the ground here."?

 I'll check the files over the weekend before I continue on with this line
of thought, I'm doubtless missing things.

Subject: olympia G2 changes
Status: OR

Here are my comments on the Olympia 2 changes, So you know where I'm coming
from I'm part of the 'Empire' that used to be headed  by Jeremy Maiden. I
consider out alliance one of the strongest and oldest but I still oppose some
of your changes as they favor the old guard over newbies.

Beastmastery
What I particularly like: change # 2

I did not like #3, It would give you only 1 or 2 monsters when you fight a
group and have capture beast in combat. It will give older more established
alliances an edge over the newer alliances. It should remain as is

Combat
What I particularly liked was changes 2,4,5,6,7

number 3 was that you'd only get half of a nobles stuff if you captured him.
This didn't make any sense. when you capture someone you should get all their
stuff. 

number 6: this is not enough. I never used the defence, swordplay, etc.
because they were too little gain for too much time. 2 points over one is
still not enough. How about a sliding scale? 4 or 5 points for each until
your at 100, 3 or 4 til 125, etc.

Castle
What I particularly like was change # 3
 
Change 2, making castles weaker in the beginning and able to be built up as
time goes on. I like the idea but the defence values don't go high enough.
Castles play little part in many of our wars because they are just too weak.
They should start at atleast value 50 and go up drastically from there.

Changes 8 and 10 I oppose because I like  the system as is. Money was always
short and if you want to get your money from taxing your fiefs then you
should be able to. You shouldn't have to be a trader and a taxing noble.

Tunnells- I love this Idea! it's the best change yet, I love the quest too.

Religion
I hate change number 6! Who's going to blow a noble point to resurect my
mage? Characters die all the time from stupid accidents, If my ten point mage
dies because I flew over water at the end of my turn then I would most likely
drop out. No ones going to resurect him and I'm not going to spend that much
time learning stuff again.
I hate change number 6.

Magic
I particularly like change number 7

4) trance should be left as is, there should be some way to get all of your
mana points back

8) I also like this as is

Sincerely,
Mike Moore
ps. how long roughly before G2? Are we talking weeks, months, or years?

But it's horrid! The 8 days to land in forest would be OK if it was on
purpose, ie the facilities at a port allow a 1 day landing in a city but
finding a beach and debarquing is difficult. How about different commands
to sail to sea and land? Ie you could explore the sea by writing

sail n e s w

and if there's land in one of those directions the sail fails because
you should have written

land n e s w

to get ashore. People who really want to get the old random landings and
launchings could alternate SAIL and LAND.

Yes, but it becomes a blocking hard limit very quickly, eg moving a workforce
of 150 into a mountain for castle building takes 29 days. It's worse for
armies: even if you used the new cheap horses to make your army entirely
riding speed it would be down to less than one square per turn movement at
300 men. OK, multiple nobles would help, but it's hard to see people using
human armies that take up lots of nobles and even then can't keep up with
land-based beast armies.

If the gradual penalty is a good thing, why not apply it to beasts as well?

Eh? They can be very similar, depending on how smart the owners are...

I agree with the motive. I just don't want these good results to also

Why not let every noble in the stack contribute to the overall
leadership? That's how movement works.

At 25/week twice a month, I don't think this is an onerous limit. But
I can still imagine weird and bad situations that would be removed if
you let all the nobles contribute their leaderships...

OK for flavor, OK for game balance. Not as nice as Atlantis' city

Bad. Basically if you go for the strategy of building many humans for
your army, you have a huge hurdle of training to go through. And if
you combine 2 huge armies into one, there's no way the top leader can
lead the stack. Ick. Yech. Blech. Bogus.

Yes, and/or you could make a trance restore only up to 1/2 or 2/3 of
your max aura. I think I like 28 days up to a max of 2/3 of your aura
(i.e. no matter where you are when you start the trance, you end at
2/3 max).

And in case I wasn't clear I think that mages without Advanced Sorcery
should also have Trance available. It's too important and too good to
be limited to super mages only.  You could fix this by making
meditation and advanced meditation better. For example, meditation
could give you 1 aura point or 5% of your max aura, whichever is
larger. Advanced meditation would be 2 aura points or 10% of your max
aura, whichever is larger. I have a mage with 40 max aura who could
auraculate now... advanced meditation would get her 4 points/week, or
she could spend 28 days on a trance and get back 26 points (2/3),
which is just over 6 points a week. Yes, that's a nice gradual
increase in capability as you get stronger.

After talking to Steve Chapin a bit, I'm convinced that Noble Points
should be strictly conserved: never destroyed, never created except 1
per 8 turns. He convinced me by pointing out that the AOO players are
all giving Barry their NPs as they drop, and with the scheme I
proposed to you a while back, he could do the same thing and simply go
way negative on NPs.

Of course, you didn't respond to that scheme, which is generally a bad
sign ;-) Making NPs strictly conserved means a little extra code when
a body decays; you would also want a DISCARD id command if you want to
kill off a noble to recover the NPs. So after you terrorize the
prisoner, you have to have NPs available or they won't swear to
you. When you decide that they're a waste of NPs, you just discard
them. Contract nobles are still bad because they eat your gold and the
enemy can capture their skills.

Hey, Scott Adams signed a $19,000,000 book contract recently.

The nice thing about NP conservation is that it removes any worries
about potions of slavery, etc. Although I still think potions of
slavery should have a % chance of killing the noble that drinks it,
maybe 33%. After all, the purpose of them was supposed to mostly be
unfriendly use, right? Yet almost all usages have been friendly
ones.
