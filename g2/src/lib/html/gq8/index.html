Fishing [603]
-------------
Usage:     FISH [number of fish] [days]
Requires:  at least one sailor

Unit must be on a ship on the ocean in order to fish.  Each day
spent fishing there is a 50% chance that the ship will come across
a school of fish.  If fish are found, each sailor will produce one
fish that day.  Provinces generate 50 fish per month which may be
obtained by fishing.

Examples:

    fish         # obtain as many fish as possible
    fish 25      # stop after getting 25 fish
    fish 0 5     # fish for five days
    fish 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 fish, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, fishing will cease as soon as the stocks in the ocean
province have been exhausted.


Weaponsmithing [617]
--------------------
Usage:  MAKE  <item> <days>
Time:   as given

Weapons and armor are required for the training of some kinds of
fighters.  Archers require longbows, for instance, elite guard
require plate armor, etc.

Weapons and armor are made with the MAKE command.  The following
weapons and armor may be produced:

    num   item           material
    ---   ----           --------
     72   longbow        yew [68]
     73   plate armor    iron [79]
     74   longsword      iron [79]
     75   pike           wood [77]
     85   crossbow       wood [77]

One unit of the input material may turned into one of the desired
items each day.  For example, MAKE 72 2 would spend two days turning
two yew [68] into two longbows [72].

See the MAKE command for further information.
