Generic NPC rules
-----------------

	o  No maintenance costs charged
	o  Do not automatically receive NP's
	o  NPCs are never taken prisoners; fight is always to the death
	o  May not use the STUDY order


Undead
------

	o  50% chance each dead enemy man becomes one of the undead.
		- undead don't take booty, prisoners?
			take_unit_item, take_prisoners
		- only booty undead take are men, they get changed
		  into undead?

	o  Health is always "dead" -- one hit kills an undead noble. (?)

	o  May summon a GHOST SHIP; cost 2NP.

		-  undead ship "Name of ship"

		-  ghost ship dissolves when no longer captained by
		   an undead noble

		-  Undead ghost ship captains do not need Sailing

	o  Undead PILLAGE causes hit to tax base, generates undead
	   followers instead of gold (1 undead to 10 gold).

	o  Undead gain 1 NP from victory in battle

	o  Undead never have less than 10 (units + NP's)

	o  Undead get a report for any graveyard with people nearby

	o  Undead may create a noble in any unoccupied graveyard

		undead form <where>

	o  undead dissolve

		undead units can reclaim themselves -- adds an NP

Undead items fight at=2, df=2:  "Undead move slowly and are not
very good fighters, but their gruesome appearance often strikes terror
into untrained fighters.  Seeing one's friends and relatives as enemies
on the battlefield, decomposing, is often unnerving."

two hard problems:

	1.  Must make prisoners, booty taking work right.

	2.  Where to start the undead?  Too many graveyards to show
	    them all...


Make npc factions
	sea kings
		points for sinking ships
	savages
		points for wrecking things
		points for bringing treasure to ...
	orcs
		points for killing people
		no items for booty
	realm of the undead

	npc factions don't grow through NP's -- grow through (points)?
	minimum number of units

	kind of faction field
	system - invisible, gm controlled -- indep, skill list, echo, gm player
	regular
	npc -- no np's
		disallow quit, although divorce player from faction


Okay... here's the re-thought about undead army rules.


-If they win a battle, they get a 75% chance per each dead enemy to turn that
dead enemy into a member of their own ranks.  (ie: If a knight died in the
battle, there is a 75% chance that the undead army will get a knight added
to their ranks.)

-There is no maintenace cost for undead.

-There is one undead castle that is the only place undead nobles can be
 formed or learn skills.  If this castle is taken over by a player, it
 will automatically be destroyed and a new one will appear in a random
 location on the map. (So they can be a constant threat.) The player who
 is the first player in the castle when it is taken over but before it
 is destroyed gets a whole bunch (5? 10? 20?) noble points for being
 so brave and risking so many troops.

-Undead nobles automatically know how to sail "ghost ships".  Ghost ships
 can be created by an undead noble and they can carry up to 100 undead
 troops (including nobles) (undead don't weigh anything)  Since ghost
 ships are etheral, they always sail at full speed regardless of wind
 condition (they need no rowers). 

-Undead nobles cost 2 noble points. All the time.

-Undead get a noble point for pillaging a city. They also get a random amount
 of undead troops.

-Undead get a noble point when they win a battle. 

-Undead DO NOT get a "standard" noble point per turn. (This means they have
 to constantly be attacking things to get noble points.

-Undead nobles automatically know all of the necromancy spells

-Undead nobles (when in the "Castle of the Undead" can spend time and
 noble points (if nessecary) to learn other magic skills.) Undead nobles
 will not need to know "normal" skills such as beastmastery or construction
 for example.

-Undead noble can not be ill and they will not heal naturally, they can
only heal through the use of a "healing" spell.

Well, what do you think?

Here's some ideas for necromancy spells:

-Summon undead soldiers:  Cost=1np, The caster gains 2d6 undead soldiers.

-Summon undead archers: Cost=1np, The caster gains 1d6 undead archers.

-Summon undead knights: Cost=2np, The caster gains 1d6 undead knights.

-Summon undead horse: Cost=1np, The caster gains 1 undead horse that can
 carry 150 units of wieght. (Mainly for carrying himself on)

-Bannish undead: Cost=1np, 2d6 undead men from the target unit are destroyed.
 
-Destroy undead: Cost=2np, 4d6 undead men from the target unit are destroyed.

-Summon Ghost ship: Cost=2np, a ghost ship will appear and the summoning unit
 oops, I mean noble, will be placed inside along with all his men and anyone
 stacked with him.  If all undead nobles leave a ghost ship, it will disapear.
 The summoning noble isn't really the captain of the ship, ths ship comes
 with an undead captain and crew.  When all nobles leave the ship, the captain
 sails his ship away.  A captain will follow orders from any undead noble though
 so as long as one noble remains on board, the ship won't disapear.

I didn't include aura points. I think that undead nobles should be able to
cast necromantic spells without using aura since they are magic in the
first place.  They'd have to use aura to cast other kinds of spells though.

You'd have to spread special weapons around that only nobles can use. They'd
have special bonus vs. undead.  Undead can't pick these weapons up, they
would have to be droped if someone with one of them was killed.  Human
nobles will never surrender to the undead, they'll keep fighting to the
last man. (In that case, maybe that 75% chance of becoming undead should
be reduced to 50
-oops-
be reduced to 50%.  That would be a bit more fair.



Well, what do you think so far?  If you like this and want to hand control 
of an undead army over to me, I'll be happy to think of some more cool
undead rules.



Oh yeah... undead will never surrender either. They'll fight to the
last man... erm... corpse. :)

Okay, an undead army... lets see...


-If they won a combat, they'd get all the defeated troops in the form of
 undead whatever they were. (ie: if they killed a knight, they would get
 an undead knight.) They wouldn't get any troops that they lost and they
 would only get enemy troops if they won.

-No maintanance cost.

-If the pillage a city, they get troops instead of gold, but the tax base
 still goes down.

-They have one castle somewhere where only their nobles can learn skills
 and new nobles can be created. They can create a noble for free, but
 can only have 10 active nobles at a time.  An undead noble can only learn
 up to two skill categories (ie: Combat and Shipcraft)... no scratch that.
 When undead nobles are created, they auto know combat...

Umm... I gotta go eat dinner.

I'll think about it some more and get back to you

Yes... graveyards!!  There can be only 10 undead nobles at a time.
When one dies, the controller (me I guess) issues a FORM command and
the specific graveyard that the undead noble will rise from.  Undead
nobles always rise with 10 (?) undead. (that way, they won't be killed
off so quickly as soon as they rise.)  When undead rise and there are
living in the graveyard they rose from, all men (not nobles) must make
a panic test. Each man has a 50% chance of fleeing (leaving the nobles
invintory). Also, each turn a living noble is in a graveyard, there is
a 2% chance of him being grabbed by the feet by skeletal hands and
being pulled under. (That way, a huge army won't just hang out in
the graveyard waiting for undead nobles to arise.)

How about when undead nobles rise from the grave, they automatically cast
a free summon undead soldiers and a free summon undead archer spell. That
way, if a living noble was hanging around a graveyard with troops, he
wouldn't just be able to automatically kill the lone undead noble.

Generate 1 NP every time they pillage also (If they collected at least
7 undead during the pillaging?)

They automatically attack everyone they meet.

The necromancy spells I sugjested would be for anyone wanting to study them,
not just undead.

If a ghost ship is attacked, it can protect 100 undead (instead of 50)
and the ship itself cannot be damaged.  If a ghost ship attacks, the
same rules apply I guess.  That way, it would be VERY unwise to venture
out on the sea if it's being haunted.

Maybe add summon undead (any type of unit except elites) to the necromantic
spells.  

Type summoned           NP cost         number summoned
Soldiers		1		3d6
Pike			1		2d6
Swordsmen		1		1d6
Archers			1		1d6
Crossbowmen		1		2d6
Knights			2		1d6

I didn't put Aura cost in cuz I don't know the scale of aura. Know what I mean?
Undead wouldn't have to expend aura anyways. They auto know all necromantic
spells at Grand Master level (or whatever the highest is) and they can't
learn any other types of spells anyways.

Maybe more to come later.  What do you think?
