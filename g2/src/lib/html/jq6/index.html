Construct siege tower [681]
---------------------------
Usage:  USE 681

Requires:  three wood [77]
           three leather [80]
           three workers [11]

Produces:  one seige tower [62]

Time:      fourteen days

The engineer directs three workers to build a wooden tower,
covered with treated leather skins or iron plating to protect
the tower from burning.  The tower contains several ladders
and a platform from which soldiers may attack.

In battle, the tower is wheeled up against an enemy's walls
and used by attacking soldiers to match the height of the
defenders.  The attackers may then climb from the tower onto
the walls.


View current aura level of others [804]
---------------------------------------
Usage:  USE 804 [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

The specified aura will be invested to learn the current aura
levels of other mages in the location.  The default amount of
aura to use is one point.

The current aura level of other mages present in the same location as
the caster will be shown, unless they are shrouding their abilities.
If a mage is employing an ability shroud, the aura invested in USE 804
must exceed the shroud's aura, or that mage's current aura level won't
be shown.

For instance, USE 804 1 will show the current aura for mages that are
not shrouding their abilities.  USE 804 3 will show the current aura
for all mages except those shrouding their abilities with three or more
points of aura.
