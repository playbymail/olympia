--------------
Usage:  USE 651 <direction or destination>
Time:   three days

The beastmaster employs the use of a bird to fly into an nearby
location and return with a report.  A direction may be given, as
with the MOVE order, or a destination may be specified.  The
destination may be any sublocation in the same province, or
any neighboring location.

For example, a bird could fly from inside a castle in a province to
spy on a tower in a city in the same province.  The bird could spy
on a neighboring province, but not enter sublocations in the
neighboring province.
