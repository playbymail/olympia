Fishing [603]
-------------
Usage:     FISH [number of fish] [days]
Requires:  at least one sailor

Unit must be on a ship on the ocean in order to fish.  Each day
spent fishing there is a 50% chance that the ship will come across
a school of fish.  If fish are found, each sailor will produce one
fish that day.  Provinces generate 50 fish per month which may be
obtained by fishing.

Examples:

    fish         # obtain as many fish as possible
    fish 25      # stop after getting 25 fish
    fish 0 5     # fish for five days
    fish 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 fish, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, fishing will cease as soon as the stocks in the ocean
province have been exhausted.


Defense [614]
-------------
Usage:  USE 614

Time:   seven days

The noble will spend time and effort practicing skills and
techniques of personal and combat defense.  Each use of 614
raises the noble's defense rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the
time the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and
will gain 10 points.


Meditate [801]
--------------
Usage:  USE 801

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

The magician enters a restful trance which regenerates body, mind
and current aura level.  Current aura level will rise by one point
or 5% of the mage's maximum aura level, whichever is higher.

Meditation is limited to raising current aura to one point above
maximum aura.
