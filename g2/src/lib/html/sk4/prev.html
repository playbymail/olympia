Mine iron [721]
---------------
Usage:  USE 721

Requires:  ten workers
Time:      7 days

Iron is widely used in the making of weapons and armor.  It
is a required component of many of the weaponsmithing skill
uses, and is also used for applying a metal tip to galley
rams and battering rams.  An iron roof provides a protective
cover for siege towers.

The character must be in a mine shaft to USE 721.  The mine's
monthly yield of iron will be obtained.  Once mined, no further
iron can be mined until the next month.

Use of this skill will cause the mine shaft to become one-third
of a level deeper.

The quantity of iron obtained will vary with the depth of the
shaft.  The largest deposits of iron are usually found in
shallow mines.
