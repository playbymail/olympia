Usage:  USE @@@@ <body>
Time:   ten days

Bring the body of a dead noble back to life.  There is a 50% chance
of success for each attempt.

If successful, the resurrected noble will be brought back to life and
stack beneath the priest.  The resurrected noble's loyalties will
remain the same as they were at the time of the noble's death, unless
the previous owner is no longer a player in the game.  In this case,
the resurrected noble will swear featly to the priest's faction.
