  From the war diaries of Keldar, Commander 1st Air Corps:


  The Early Years
  ---------------

  First landfall was made on Atnos, soon after setting sail.  Despite
  a serious sentimental attachment to the place, we decided to press
  on.  When we struck Krussos, we knew we had found a home.  Scouts
  were dispatched, and an expedition to circumnavigate the island
  was launched.  At the time, we had no idea how huge Krussos would
  prove to be.

  Other factions in the alliance settled into the castle routine,
  but we chose to remain largely unencumbered.  A small castle
  was eventually built as a base of operations, but this was later
  razed.  It was during this period that we made a significant
  decision that would later prove to be a serious mistake: upon
  our arrival, we had pored over the available texts on Noble Lineage
  and Inheritance, and concluded that the only way to expand our scope
  and reach was to quest extensively for control artifacts, since the
  natural laws limited our body of nobles.  In retrospect, seeking
  loopholes in the Inheritance laws would have been a more productive
  undertaking.

  Much knowledge and experience was gained during these years, and
  the War College graduated a number of fine cadets.

  The eastern portion of Krussos was secured at a fairly leisurely
  pace.  A border with the Northern Lights Alliance was set up near the
  middle of Krussos, and a small enclave in the southeast held by another
  group was tolerated for some time, until repeated border violations
  lead to their demise.  The sudden and unexpected collapse of the
  Northern Lights Alliance, and some adroit diplomacy by others in our
  own alliance, left us in control of the entire continent.  We were in
  no particular hurry to proclaim a king however, and indeed this did
  not occur during the period when we were still part of Krussos.

  A few of the factions decided to resign from the Krussos alliance
  and join with the groups on Atala.  We toyed with the notion, but
  eventually the Grand Council decided that there was just too much
  peace in the area, and while leaving Krussos did indeed seem indicated,
  joining Atala would not further our own goals.  By this time we had
  wide ranging scouts reporting on the world, and many possible avenues
  for growth.  It seemed an ideal time to leave the cradle and set forth
  on our own path.

  We parted ways with Krussos under friendly circumstances, handing
  over our lands and resigning our commissions.  The Nagus even managed
  to get one of his people into the distribution list for the monthly
  Atala garrison reports (even rising to become head of the chain!),
  despite never having any actual presence on Atala at all.

  We had spent nearly three Great Cycles learning and preparing, and
  allowing the Great Wars on Provinia to play themselves out.  It
  was now time to enter the fray.
