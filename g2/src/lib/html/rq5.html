Combat [610]
------------
The student of combat learns the training of soldiers and how
to lead them well in battle.  With study and experience, the
battle lord will find strategies to be used in difficult combat
situations.

The following skills may be studied directly once Combat is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   611    Survive fatal wound                four weeks
   612    Fight to the death                 four weeks
   613    Construct catapult                 two weeks
   614    Defense                            two weeks
   615    Archery                            three weeks

Magic [800]
-----------
No apprentice magician can rightfully don the robes of his order without
some knowledge of Magic [800].  Magic contains many spells useful on
their own, as well as in conjunction with spells from the other schools 
of sorcery.

The following skills may be studied directly once Magic is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
   801    Meditate                           two weeks
   802    Perform common tasks for gold      two weeks
   803    Appear common                      two weeks
