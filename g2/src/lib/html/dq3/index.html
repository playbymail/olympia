Weaponsmithing [617]
--------------------
Usage:  MAKE  <item> <days>
Time:   as given

Weapons and armor are required for the training of some kinds of
fighters.  Archers require longbows, for instance, elite guard
require plate armor, etc.

Weapons and armor are made with the MAKE command.  The following
weapons and armor may be produced:

    num   item           material
    ---   ----           --------
     72   longbow        yew [68]
     73   plate armor    iron [79]
     74   longsword      iron [79]
     75   pike           wood [77]
     85   crossbow       wood [77]

One unit of the input material may turned into one of the desired
items each day.  For example, MAKE 72 2 would spend two days turning
two yew [68] into two longbows [72].

See the MAKE command for further information.
