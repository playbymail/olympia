Fishing [603]
-------------
Usage:     FISH [number of fish] [days]
Requires:  at least one sailor

Unit must be on a ship on the ocean in order to fish.  Each day
spent fishing there is a 50% chance that the ship will come across
a school of fish.  If fish are found, each sailor will produce one
fish that day.  Provinces generate 50 fish per month which may be
obtained by fishing.

Examples:

    fish         # obtain as many fish as possible
    fish 25      # stop after getting 25 fish
    fish 0 5     # fish for five days
    fish 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 fish, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, fishing will cease as soon as the stocks in the ocean
province have been exhausted.
