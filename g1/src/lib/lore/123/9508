#Skill: Breed beasts [9508]
#
Usage:  BREED <item> <item>
Time:   seven days

Attempt to breed two animals together to produce an offspring.
Not all animals produce successful offspring.  Occasionally,
cross-breeding different beasts will produce strange results.

For example:

	To breed two wild horses together:

		BREED 51 51

	To attempt a cross-breed of a horse and an ox:

		BREED 51 76

Because some animals are often unpredictable and violent, there
is a small chance that one of the breeding parents will be killed
in the attempt.

Wild horses [51], riding horses [52] and warmounts [53] may be used
interchangably with BREED.
