WORK 
Time:    7 days
-------------------------

Nobles desperate for funds may perform unskilled labor for wages.
Menial labor does not pay well, usually 2-3 gold per day.
Unskilled labor jobs are generally available only in cities.


One:

Because of their well-to-do upbringing, Nobles cannot stand
performing menial labor for more than two weeks each month.


Two:

Because of their well-to-do upbringing, nobles find menial labor
distasteful.  While they will endure some amount of drudgery each
month, nobles quickly grow dissatisfied with a lord that wastes
their talent on unskilled tasks.  The first week of menial labor
each month will not change a noble's loyalty.  Additional work,
however, will reduce the noble's loyalty, and may eventually
convince him to find a better lord to serve.



Ideas:

	1st week - make money, no problem
	2nd	1
	3rd	2
	4th	3

	3rd week - 33% chance make more money
		   33% loyalty hit, but make money
		   33% spend the week in a pub, lose money


%s claims that no menial jobs were available, and instead
spent the week

%s refused to engage in further menial labor, and
instead spent the week 
		in a pub
		in a brothel
		chasing locals of the opposite sex
		starting fights in the town square (health hit)

%s claims to have contracted an illness, and so was unable to work.
