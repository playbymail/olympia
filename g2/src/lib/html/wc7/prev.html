Time:   seven days

level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the
time the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and
will gain 10 points.


Swordplay [616]
---------------
Usage:  USE 616
Time:   seven days

Use of 616 will cause the noble to spend time and effort practicing
swordplay, for use in personal combat.  Each seven-day use of 616
raises the noble's attack rating by 3-5 points if his starting
level is less than 100, and 1-3 points thereafter.  5% of the time
the noble will have an exceptionally good study period and will
gain 10 points.

Knowledge of Swordplay also allows the noble to train swordsmen,
knights, and elite guards, via the TRAIN order.




Harvest lumber [702]
--------------------
Usage:     WOOD [number] [days]
Time:      as given or necessary
Requires:  at least one worker [11]

Workers enter the forest and select trees which are suitable for felling
and sawing.  Lumber is used in the construction of ships, buildings and
some weapons.  Timber is also used to support the roofs of mine shafts.

Must be used in a forest province.  Forests generate 30 wood [77] each
month.

Examples:

    wood         # obtain as much wood as possible
    wood 25      # stop after getting 25 wood
    wood 0 5     # cut timber for five days
    wood 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 wood, whichever
                 # comes first

In all cases, timber cutting will cease as soon as the forest's supply
of wood for the month has been exhausted.

WOOD is an alias for COLLECT 77.
