Shipbuilding [602]
------------------
Usage:     BUILD galley "Name of ship"
or         BUILD roundship "Name of ship"

Requires:  at least three workers [11]
	   50 wood [77] for a galley, 100 wood for a roundship

Time:      250 worker-days for a galley, 500 for a roundship

To begin construction of a ship, the shipbuilder should unstack from
beneath other characters and issue one of the BUILD orders.  One-fifth
of the lumber is required to start construction.  The rest is deducted
as progress on the ship is made (the second fifth at 20% completion,
the third fifth at 40% completion, etc.)

The shipbuilder and his workers will be placed inside the new ship.

As soon as the required number of worker-days has been invested in
construction, the ship will be christened and declared seaworthy.

To resume construction of a partially completed ship, first enter the
ship, then issue the either "build galley" or "build roundship".

Ships may only be built in locations with a passable route to an
ocean, such as a port city.


Construction [680]
------------------
The domain of engineers, builders and architects, Construction
concerns the erection of inns, castles, city walls, and other
fortifications.

some knowledge of Magic [800].  Magic contains many spells useful on
their own, as well as in conjunction with spells from the other schools 
of sorcery.

The following skills may be studied directly once Magic is known:

   num    skill                              time to learn
   ---    -----                              -------------
