#Skill:  Persuade oathbound noble [9536]
#
Usage:   USE @@@@ <target> [flag]
Time:    seven days

Attempt to persuade an oathbound noble to defect.  There is
only a chance of success when used on oath-1 nobles.  Oath-2
nobles will not leave their lord under any circumstances.

@@@@ costs 25 gold per use, to pay for gifts, fine meals, handsome
clothing, and other props useful in the persuasion attempt.

Each seven day use yields a 2% chance of success.

If flag is 1, and the persuasion attempt is successful, the target
character will stack with the persuading character.
